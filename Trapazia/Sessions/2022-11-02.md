## 2nd of Harvest

### Fayrun

Now in Fayrun, Grimsby takes us to The Library, which is a tavern and Inn. Fayrun has a big day drinking culture. We order brunch and mimosas.

The Library has hotel rooms themed after fairy tales.

The Archive - Building with collection of various ancient books and knowledge.
The Temple of Nazri - Books and things related to the Goddess Nazri.

### The University
We start walking toward the university to find Guylar Prez.
On the way there we see a group of rock and clay constructs with red crystals in their chest. 

Fayrun has no government, no politicians, no police. The constructs act as guardians to keep peace.

We reach the campus. It's very large. We find Guylar Prez in his office.

#### Guylar Prez
[[Krinqwok]] gifts him some weed.

Elder Qwoff has been gone for many quarters. He had been focused on divine fragments. They are the key to accessing planes that are closed off. The Krull tribes goal is to access higher planes. The border between planes is very thin. The divine fragments are gifts from the gods that each go to a different plane. The higher planes are hardest to get to.

The Abyssal plane is very chaotic. The demon lords dictate what the abyssal plan is.
The barrier between the abyssal plane grows thinner when bad deeds are committed.

Demon Lords (8 of them) - 
• Demogorgon – The Prince of Demons 
• Orcus – Prince of the Undead
• Graz’zt – The Dark Prince
• Baphomet – The Horned King
• Fraz-Urb'luu – The Prince of Deception
• Juiblex – The Faceless Lord
• Yeenoghu – The Beast of Butchery
• Zuggtmoy – The Demon Queen of Fungi

Graz'zt is the guy from the mirror.

The Demogorgon is the demon Lord we heard in Farmer's Nook. He has the signature sound of baboons. The is a gruesome creature with 2 baboon heads.

### The Archive
The archive is a large building. It is community run. All information is peer reviewed. Each of us is assigned a curator that will escort us. They ask each of us our name and where we were born.

Bartolo
- Jawree's Mask
- In a book "The Ancient Cities of Trapazia", it mentions The Crying Mask of Cascardia. Location of mask not known.
- Cascardia was located where what is now callled the Suclidean Maw.

Jasper
- the obsidian eye
- Jasper finds reference to the King's Eye. The kings eye is from when there was a royal family in Adelgate. It was a secret organization put together by the king. Kind of like the CIA. To gather information on Adelgate and area for the King. Kept in secret.
- When the Wescove royal family ended, the kings eye disbanded. Members of the kings eye have rumored to start their own group.

Krinqwok
- Planar travel
- No record of anyone reaching the higher planes. People have traveled to lower planes. Many ended in the person not returning. Not many references of people going to the Abyssal plane and coming back.
- Tuning Forks have been used to travel to the elemental planes.

Harper
- Mostly flirting with her Curator (Kiara), but also asks about items given to individuals from Demon Lords
- Divine fragments were items given from beings of different planes to the material plane.
- Not much information about breaking the link between the Deity and the object.
- For minor demons you can use Minor restoration. For superior beings, there is usually a physical manifestation on their bodies to replace the part that was imparted into an item.

Grimsby
- Graz'zt
- Not originally a demon. He was actually a devil. More interested in the pleasure of life and satisfying your inner id. He transferred over into the abyssal plane. Less chaotic than other abyssal lords. The rest are like caged animals, no strategy. Graz'zt keeps himself off to the side, very intelligent. He likes to come into the material plane with his demons to cause havoc, he finds it fun. Items from that plane, such as the [[Mirror]] are given as a way of communicating across planes.
- There are accounts of people making deals with the devil. He's not interested in twisting peoples words. He's not trying to catch you in details, but he will ask for something in return. It's hard to get his demons into the material plane, so he will ask people to carry out his bidding in exchange for their desires. When making this agreement a Chain tattoo appears on your hand and only disappears when the task is complete.
