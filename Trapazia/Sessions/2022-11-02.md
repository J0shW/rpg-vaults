## 2nd of Harvest

### Fayrun

Now in Fayrun, Grimsby takes us to The Library, which is a tavern and Inn. Fayrun has a big day drinking culture. We order brunch and mimosas.

The Library has hotel rooms themed after fairy tales.

The Archive - Building with collection of various ancient books and knowledge.
The Temple of Nazri - Books and things related to the Goddess Nazri.

### The University
We start walking toward the university to find Guylar Prez.
On the way there we see a group of rock and clay constructs with red crystals in their chest. 

Fayrun has no government, no politicians, no police. The constructs act as guardians to keep peace.

We reach the campus. It's very large. We find Guylar Prez in his office.

#### Guylar Prez
[[Krinqwok]] gifts him some weed.

Elder Qwoff has been gone for many quarters. He had been focused on divine fragments. They are the key to accessing planes that are closed off. The Krull tribes goal is to access higher planes. The border between planes is very thin. The divine fragments are gifts from the gods that each go to a different plane. The higher planes are hardest to get to.

The Abyssal plane is very chaotic. The demon lords dictate what the abyssal plan is.
The barrier between the abyssal plane grows thinner when bad deeds are committed.

Demon Lords (8 of them) - 
• Demogorgon – The Prince of Demons 
• Orcus – Prince of the Undead
• Graz’zt – The Dark Prince
• Baphomet – The Horned King
• Fraz-Urb'luu – The Prince of Deception
• Juiblex – The Faceless Lord
• Yeenoghu – The Beast of Butchery
• Zuggtmoy – The Demon Queen of Fungi

Graz'zt is the guy from the mirror.

The Demogorgon is the demon Lord we heard in Farmer's Nook. He has the signature sound of baboons. The is a gruesome creature with 2 baboon heads.

### The Archive
The archive is a large building. It is community run. All information is peer reviewed. Each of us is assigned a curator that will escort us. They ask each of us our name and where we were born.
