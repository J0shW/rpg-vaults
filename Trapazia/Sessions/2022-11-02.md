## 2nd of Harvest

### Fayrun

Now in Fayrun, Grimsby takes us to The Library, which is a tavern and Inn. Fayrun has a big day drinking culture. We order brunch and mimosas.

The Library has hotel rooms themed after fairy tales.

The Archive - Building with collection of various ancient books and knowledge.
The Temple of Nazri - Books and things related to the Goddess Nazri.

### The University
We start walking toward the university to find Guylar Prez.
On the way there we see a group of rock and clay constructs with red crystals in their chest. 

Fayrun has no government, no politicians, no police. The constructs act as guardians to keep peace.

We reach the campus. It's very large. 

#### Guylar Prez
[[Krinqwok]] gifts him some weed.

Elder Qwoff has been gone for many quarters. He had been focused on divine fragments. They are the key to accessing planes that are closed off. The Krull tribes goal is to access higher planes. The border between planes is very thin. The divine fragments are gifts from the gods that each go to a different plane. The higher planes are hardest to get to.
