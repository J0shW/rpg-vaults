## 14th of Growth

### Speak with the Dead
Jasper asks Sasionel 5 questions
1. Why are you in the desert?
	- Honestly I do not know. I attempted to cast a spell and something went horribly wrong.
2. What was the spell supposed to do?
	- Attempting to teleport myself to safety.
	- Trying to escape from undead creatures on the ship, but it teleported the whole ship.
3. Where were you when this happened?
	- Tasked to do a 30 day expedition on [[Jackal Island]]. Had to leave. Heading back to [[Port Valoor]]. We were south of Trapazia on the southern coast.
4. What was the expedition for?
	- We were hired under secrecy to gather samples of vegetation and wildlife from the southern coast of the island. We were there for 7 days, but they were not prepared for the danger they found there and had to leave way sooner than expected.
- How can we find [[Marsden]]?
	- He is a fish monger at the Seafarer Market in [[Port Valoor]]

### Investigate the Ship
Izan opens a chest, a poison dart hurts him, but inside he finds a Glass shard that has water swirling around it.

Jasper and Grimsby find a knocked over jar in the ground. A green slime residue is inside. We believe this is the source of how the crew became undead zombies. We decide to destroy the slime residue.

We suspect the Plant we got in the auction could also be from the same expedition. We will ask around [[Mahrez]] and [[Port Valoor]] to see if anyone knows who the seller was.

We go to bed on the ship.
