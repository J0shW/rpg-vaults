## 12th of Growth
### The Purple Man
His name is [[Graz'zt]], he might be Drow. We are compelled to speak with him. He asks each of us our name and our deepest desire.
[[Harper]] - The respect of her family
[[Jasper]] - Being remembered for his writing
[[Grimsby]] - Not sure. Follows new whims all the time
[[Izen]] - Name is [[Bartolo]], wants freedom from this body

Says the gem we hold are fragmented. The remaining pieces are in the [[Adelcrest Forest]] and have found a home. [[Jasper]] believes he is talking about the 4 gems that we took from the antichamber beneath the bandit hideout in [[Farmer's Nook]]. We possess 4 gems (1 from each palm of the dead parent's hands). Is [[Graz'zt]] implying that the child known as [[The Missing Piece]], which has the remaining gems, is to be found in the [[Adelcrest Forest]]?

[[Fialfar]] is the half human half lion who died. She was one of Graz'zt lieutenants.

[[Izen]] walks near the [[Mirror]]. [[Bartolo]] starts to speak with Graz'zt and wants to strike a deal with him to become freed from [[Izen]]. [[Izen]] suddenly snaps back into control of his body before [[Bartolo]] can make the deal. [[Izen]] then urges everyone to quickly leave the tower.

Graz'zt tells us to take the small hand [[Mirror]] on the desk. We can use it to contact him. [[Grimsby]] takes it despite [[Izen]]'s protest.

We leave the tower and find that the jackalwere camp has been deserted.

### [[Izen]] Opens Up
[[Kilikar]] promises to get us safely through the desert to make up for his misdeeds in trying to kill us. But  suggests we stay the night in the camp before venturing out into the desert.

[[Jasper]] speaks with [[Izen]] very bluntly. Asking him what's going on with him. We all know there is an inner conflict he is battling. He tells us about [[Bartolo]].

[[Bartolo]] has a criminal history. He sought refuge to hide somewhere. [[Izen]] coincidentally was in a possession to provide that to him. Now [[Bartolo]] lives inside himself, but wants out to wreak havoc. He's irresponsible and selfish. We promise to try to get him help, but that we will never fully trust him.

We try to destroy the hand [[Mirror]] from Graz'zt but smashing it and eldritch blasting it did not work. [[Grimsby]] wants to bury it, but we decide we should hang on to it and find a safer place for it or a proper way to destroy it. [[Grimsby]] feeds it to his ethereal Bear from the goat bag, hoping it will disappear with the bear at dawn.

We sleep the night. [[Grimsby]] has the bear watch the tower entrance to stop [[Izen]] from going back up to the big [[Mirror]] to talk to Graz'zt.

[[Izen]] wakes up in the night, casts silence around the bear. Then kills the bear. The [[Mirror]] drops to the ground. [[Izen]] hides it on himself then goes back to bed.

[[Grimsby]] wakes up and the bear is gone.

## 13th of Growth
### The Missing [[Mirror]]
The [[Mirror]] is gone when we wake up. [[Grimsby]] thinks that it disappeared with the bear to the ethereal plane. [[Jasper]] and [[Harper]]  are skeptical of this. [[Izen]] starts speaking to us, but his words come out as gibberish. This lasts for a minute before it goes away. [[Harper]] is confused, as this seems like the type of wild chaos magic that happens to her when her spells go awry. But [[Izen]] is sure he didn't cast any spells. Very mysterious. 

[[Izen]] knows he has the hand [[Mirror]] in his possession, but does not tell any of us.

[[Kilikar]] urges us to get a move on because the desert becomes very hot during the day.

### The [[Pirilago Desert]]
[[Kilikar]] leads us into the desert. We travel for a few days and the blistering heat takes a toll on us, except [[Harper]]'s infernal heritage keeps her from being exhausted. Also the freezing nights cause our sleep to be less restful. [[Izen]] takes 1 level of exhaustion after a particularly cold night.

On our second day in the desert (14th of Growth) we encounter 2 fire elementals. [[Jasper]] nearly goes down in the encounter (1 hp), but the group manages to keep him alive. [[Izen]]'s use of the slow spell is key in ensuring our survival, and [[Harper]]'s use of cold Chromatic Orbs deal huge damage and kill the elementals in the end.

We take a short rest after the battle to heal up.

End of session.
