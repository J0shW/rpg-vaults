## 2nd of Birth

### The Purple Man
His name is Graz'zt, he might be Drow. We are compelled to speak with him. He asks each of us our name and our deepest desire.
Harper - The respect of her family
Jasper - Being remembered for his writing
Grimsby - Not sure. Follows new whims all the time
Izan - Name is Bartollow, wants freedom from this body

Says the gem we hold are fragmented. The remaining pieces are in the Adelcrest forest and have found a home.

Fialfar is the half human half lion who died.


Bartollow has a criminal history. He saught refuge to hide somewhere. Izan coincidentally was in a possiyion to provide that to him. Now bartollow lives inside himself, but wants out to wreak havok. He's irresponsible and selfish
