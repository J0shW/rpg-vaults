## 2nd of Birth

### The Purple Man
His name is Graz'zt, he might be Drow. We are compelled to speak with him. He asks each of us our name and our deepest desire.
Harper - The respect of her family
Jasper - Being remembered for his writing
Grimsby - Not sure. Follows new whims all the time
Izan - Name is Bartollow, wants freedom from this body

Says the gem we hold are fragmented. The remaining pieces are in the Adelcrest forest and have found a home.

Fialfar is the half human half lion who died. She was one of Graz'zt lieutenants.

Izan walks near the mirror. Bartollow starts to speak with Graz'zt and wants to strike a deal with him to become freed from Izan. Izan suddenly snaps back into control of his body before Bartollow can make the deal. Izan then urges everyone to quickly leave the tower.

Graz'zt tells us to take the small hand mirror on the desk. We can use it to contact him. Grimsby takes it despite Izan's protest.

We leave the tower and find that the jackalwere camp has been deserted.

[[Kilikar]] promises to get us safely through the desert to make up for his misdeeds in trying to kill us. But  suggests we stay the night in the camp before venturning out into the desert.

Jasper speaks with Izan very bluntly. Asking him what's going on with him. We all know there is an inner conflict he is battling. He tells us about Bartollow.

Bartollow has a criminal history. He saught refuge to hide somewhere. Izan coincidentally was in a possiyion to provide that to him. Now bartollow lives inside himself, but wants out to wreak havok. He's irresponsible and selfish. We promise to try to get him help, but that we will never fully trust him.

We try to destroy the hand mirror from Graz'zt but smashing it and eldritch blasting it did not work. Grimsby wants to bury it, but we decide we should hang on to it and find a safer place for it or a proper way to destroy it. Grimsby feeds it to his ethereal Bear from the goat bag, hoping it will dissappear with the bear at dawn.

We sleep the night. Grimsby has the bear watch the tower entrance to stop Izan from going back up to the big mirror to talk to Graz'zt.

Izan wakes up in the night, casts silence around the bear. Then kills the bear. The mirror drops to the ground. Izan hides it on himself then goes back to bed.

Grimsby wakes up and the bear is gone.
