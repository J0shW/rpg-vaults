## 2nd of Birth

### The Escape
Kilikar pulls a key from his carapace and unlocks the cage. We also unlock the cage of and Orc named [[Morull]] of the Dragrock Tribe, and a Gnoll, kobold, and kenku. 

We decide to not let out the feral yeti creature yet.

Kilikar tells us our equipment is being stored at the top of a tower.

Statue with many hands holding a book, scimitar, an orb a weapon, a magnifying glass, a pen. Known as the knowing scholar. It is Nazri. Deals with everything intellectual and knowledge based. Grimsby recognizes it immediately as it is a big deity in [[Fayrun]]. Grimsby remembers that one of these had been stolen from the Library in Fayrun and now it is here. There are gems inset all around the statue. Some of the gems seem to have been uncovered recently.
