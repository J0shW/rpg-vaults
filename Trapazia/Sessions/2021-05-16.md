## 2nd of Birth

### The Escape
Kilikar pulls a key from his carapace and unlocks the cage. We also unlock the cage of and Orc named [[Morull]] of the Dragrock Tribe, and a Gnoll, kobold, and kenku. 

We decide to not let out the feral yeti creature yet.

Kilikar tells us our equipment is being stored at the top of a tower. There are 2 Jackalweres guarding the entrance to the tower. Grimsby uses message in their minds and tells them to come to the Sphinx's quarters, while impersonating the voice of Sphinx. They enter the tower. Uh Oh! that means the Sphinx is in the tower and when they get to her they will realize it was a ruse and they will know we are coming.

We race into the tower after them, heading up the stairs. We find the Jackalweres at the top and Izan casts Crown of Madness on one of them, and they proceed to kill each other.

On this landing is a statue with many hands holding a book, scimitar, an orb a weapon, a magnifying glass, a pen. Known as the knowing scholar. It is Nazri. Deals with everything intellectual and knowledge based. Grimsby recognizes it immediately as it is a big deity in [[Fayrun]]. Grimsby remembers that one of these had been stolen from the Library in Fayrun and now it is here. There are gems inset all around the statue. Some of the gems seem to have been uncovered recently.

An Inscription reads: Speak the word and learn it's secrets.
There are 6 unique gems, each in varying numbers.
Amber x 19 = S
Jade x 3 = C
Onyx x 18 = R
Pearl x 15 = O
Ruby x 12 = L
Sapphire x 12 = L

Secret Word: SCROLL

As Grimsby says the word "Scroll", a scroll appear and presents itself to Grimsby. The scroll can grant the user knowledge about anything, they must just spend 10 minutes studying the book to discover the answers.

We move on through the doors on the other end of the hall and enter the Sphinx's room. The Sphinx tells Kilikar that he has done well. His last challenge is to kill us, then he will receive the Sphinx's blessing. Kilikar was following the Sphinx's orders all along. It was a trap. 

3 demons rise from the ground and start attacking us. Grimsby casts charm person on Kilikar to get him to help us instead of harming us. The Sphinx doesn't attack us the entire time. We dispatch of the 3 demons quickly.

As we kill the last demon, we hear a squeal of pain from the corner of the room, where we see a human hiding behind a chair. As pain riddles their body, the illusion that was disguising them drops and they are no longer a human, but actually a half human, half lion creature. The die on the ground in front of us. As they draw their last breath the image of the Sphinx fades as well. 

Then we hear another sound from the opposite side of the room. A mirror glowing with purple light shows an image of a purple skinned man with spiky hair. He says something in abyssal that we can't understand. Then he says "Welcome".

End of session.
