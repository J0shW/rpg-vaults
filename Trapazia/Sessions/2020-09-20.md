# `fas:PenNib` Session 2: September 20, 2020
---

- The 4 people that were less ragged were abducted from the execution
- The 2 older ones were there from prior
- Kidnapping civilians for a while
- “Pulled away, a couple weeks ago”
- An older guy and a young tiefling
  
In the room that big bugs were in, treasure chest with 206gp, 120sp, a stone bird statue (100gp), glassware (75gold), rapier, gloves, staff.

I receive the magical Rapier, I don’t yet know what it does
  
We then go down the tunnel that leads out of the prisoner room. Room that smells like rotting flesh. The bodies were eaten by the insects. This was a feeding den of sorts. 

We proceed down a tunnel leading from the feeding den. We see a smaller room with seemingly nothing in it. There is another tunnel leading out of it. This path leads back to the main tunnel. So we did a circle.
 
We then return to the people and escort them back to adelgate.


We take a short rest and attune to our new magical items.

Rapier is really light, It’s a +1 Rapier!

Receive a pamphlet from Izan “One night only, come see the amazing Izan at the ___ tavern“


We continue travelling, and Grimsby hears a goat talking to him. The goat is named [[Robin Goodfellow]]. We follow, but can’t hear Robin speaking. Grimsby appears crazy as usual. 
Robin takes on many guises and today he chose to be a goat.


We make our way to the city gates.
I find it very odd that the gates are closed. 
A huge river cuts through the city.

The guards let us into the city but they put us in cuffs for questioning. We are taken to the cells at the city guards building.

[[Oslo]] is a tall male elf in elegant robes. [[Fez]] is a halfling with tattered robes, he is a detective. Oslo is Fez’s employee.

Oslo can get us out in exchange for a favor.

They want us to investigate a town called Farmers' Nook. Problems of outsiders attacking the town.

Oslo escorts us out in cuffs. We go through a door in the city walls. He uncuffs us. And points us in the direction of Farmer’s Nook.

  
Grimsby jokingly entitles my book:
“Land Pirates!” by Jasper Flint


[[Wayra]] speaking in my mind.  She says [[Lionel]] is requesting my presence to figure out my status and discuss details on future work.

Lionel Kines is the president of the Adelgate Scriveners Guild (basically J. Jonah Jameson)

They have a Cleric on staff to send messages. Wayra. 

 
Our camp is interrupted by 5 Gnolls with some 2-headed dogs.

Grimsby casts Summon lesser demons. The demons look like little Fey creatures with goat legs, crown of thorns and bees buzzing around them.

We kill the remaining Gnolls.
