## 46th of Birth
### The Bazaar
Harper and Grimsby go to the market. Harper remembers seeing an empty stall there which seemed suspicious. She believes it might be [[Lorelei Felzwin]]'s seamstress stall. 

They speak to [[Jipple]] the seamstress that sold Harper clothing yesterday. Jipple says she was very focused on her work, always the first stall open and last to close. But the last few weeks she barely made it into work at all. She believes it has to do with Joffrey. Jipple describes [[Joffrey]] as an Elven man with blonde hair, and blue eyes.

Grimsby is also interested in some new clothes and for some reason really wants all of it to be orange. Jipple sells Grimsby a whole orange outfit. Grimsby wears a green scarf with it and now basically looks like a walking carrot.

### The Town Guard
Izan and Pod go to the town guard building. We see a male halfling with a hat asleep at a desk. We wake him and he introduces himself as [[Roker Lee]]. He is not helpful and resistant to telling us details of the case. Izan casts suggestion on Roker, he gives us the case file and tells us to visit the coroner [[Wendy Harkin]].

Izan tells me in secret that he believes some suspicious folk may be out to get him at the auction in a few days.

We meet up with Harper and Grimsby. We are not at all surprised to see Grimsby in his carrot outfit.

The case files tell us that Lorelei was found hanging from the neck in her apartment, so they believe it to be a suicide.

### The Morgue
Wendy greets us and after seeing that we have the case file, agrees to discuss her findings with us. There are inconsistencies with the bruising on her neck, that don't appear to be from a hanging, possibly from a garrote.

I cast Speak with the Dead on Lorelei. My Quill and book levitate and it begins to draw arcane symbols in the book, a low green glow begins and passes into the body. Lorelei is temporarily resurrected. We ask her a few questions before she is lifeless again.

#### Questions for Lorelei:
1. Who killed you? 
	- [[Joffrey]] Steins
2. Where did it happen?
	- Home
3. Why were you killed?
	- A puppet master doesn't need their puppets, once their done.
4. Where can we find him?
	- I don't know, but he's not in Mahrez
5. What was your relationship with Joffrey?
	- He was my lover, at least I thought.

### The Great Ruse
Izan comes up with a devilish plan to capture Joffrey.

Pod casts disguise self to appear as Lorelei. He walks around town a little bit to stir up rumors that Lorelei is alive, so that we can draw out Joffrey and capture him. We believe the ruse has caught on.

Now still as Lorelei, Pod walks into Lorelei's apartment to lie in wait for Joffrey to return. Izan and Harper stake out the apartment for someone to return. Grimsby is told to wait with the downstairs neighbor, for obvious reasons.

### Confronting a killer
Many hours later, in the dark of night, Pod hears a small creek as the door to Lorelei's apartment opens. Pod casts message to Grimsby that someone is in the room. Then Pod also casts invisibility on himself. Grimsby signals the others and they enter the apartment.

We surround Joffrey, beat him up a little, and cast suggestion on him.

He tells us he used Lorelei for her money, killed her and fled. He's done this many times before. He offers us money to free him.

Izan kills Joffrey with a poison spray, there's nothing the rest of us can do to stop him.

We are in shock at what Ian has done. We now have to come up with a plan to not look like criminals ourselves. Izan takes the gold Joffrey had on him (1000 gp). 

Izan goes to [[Roker Lee]] and brings him to the apartment. We explain that we believe he killed Lorelei. Roker recognizes the man as [[Artem]], a known criminal who they have been trying to catch for some time. He's killed a dozen or more women with the same con.

Roker thanks us and pays out the Wanted contract to us of 5000 gold! (1250 each).

We level up to ==level 7==.
