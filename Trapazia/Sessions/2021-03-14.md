## 40? of Birth

### The Bazaar
Harper and Grimsby go to the market. Harper remembers seeing an empty stall there which seemed suspicious. She believes it might be [[Lorelei]]'s seamstress stall. 

They speak to [[Jipple]] the seamstress that sold Harper clothing yesterday. Jipple says she was very focused on her work, always the first stall open and last to close. But the last few weeks she barely made it into work at all. She believes it has to do with Joffrey. Jipple describes [[Joffrey]] as an Elven man with blonde hair, and blue eyes.

### The Town Guard
We see a male halfling with a hat
