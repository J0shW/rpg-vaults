## 46th of Birth
### The Bazaar
Harper and Grimsby go to the market. Harper remembers seeing an empty stall there which seemed suspicious. She believes it might be [[Lorelei]]'s seamstress stall. 

They speak to [[Jipple]] the seamstress that sold Harper clothing yesterday. Jipple says she was very focused on her work, always the first stall open and last to close. But the last few weeks she barely made it into work at all. She believes it has to do with Joffrey. Jipple describes [[Joffrey]] as an Elven man with blonde hair, and blue eyes.

### The Town Guard
We see a male halfling with a hat asleep at a desk. We wake him and he introduces himself as [[Roker Lee]]. He is not helpful and resistant to telling us details of the case. Izan casts suggestion on Roker, he gives us the case file and tells us to visit the coroner [[Wendy Harkin]].

Izan tells me in secret that he believes some suspicious folk may be out to get him at the auction in a few days.

We meet up with Harper and Grimsby.

Case files tell us that Lorelei was found hanging from the neck in her apartment, so they believe it to be a suicide.

### The Morgue
Wendy greets us and after seeing that we have the case file, agrees to discuss her findings with us.

I cast Speak with the Dead on Lorelei. My Quill and book levitate and it begins to draw arcane symbols in the book, a low green glow begins and passes into the body. Lorelei is temporarily resurrected.

#### Questions for Lorelei:
1. Who killed you? - [[Joffrey]] Steins
2. Where did it happen? - Home
3. Why were you killed? - A puppet master doesn't need their puppets, once their done.
4. Where can we find them?  - I don't know, but he's not in Mahrez
5. What was your relationship with Joffrey? - He was my lover, at least I thought.
