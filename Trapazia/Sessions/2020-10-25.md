# `fas:PenNib` Session 4: October 25, 2020

Izan does detect magic on the crack and detects evocation magic beyond the crack.

I pry away the dirt around the crack and it opens up into a cobblestone tunnel. I lead the group into the tunnel.
We come upon a room with cages. Blood smeared on the walls. Some cages are ripped open, some still intact.

All the halls are lit with magical blue torches.

On a curved wall, there is a mural with a depiction of creatures.

The next room is just a singular walkway with pits to either side of it. There are 2 statues on either side of the path. We blow up the statues, then walk across to the next room.

Four skulls, one glowing blue, red, yellow, green. The skulls dont look the same. Green has horns, tielfing. Red has tusks, orcish. Blue is slender, elf. Yellow, is stout dwarf skull. They don’t look like bone, they look like gemstone. Jade, Ruby, Sapphire, Amber.

I touch the blue elf skull. The light flickers, dims and enters me. I now have to speak in rhyme.
Izan touches the red skull. He is afraid of the letter “F”.
Grimsby touches, yellow and can only yell or whisper.
Harper touches green and can only interrupt people.

We leave and enter a temple room. Spikes that jut out of the floor. The mural continues all the way into this room. Depicting monstrosities moving toward the back wall. Spikes are made of obsidian. On the alter there is a pedestal that lights up Izan’s detect magic. There is a large blue topaz crystal. At the center point of the mural, there is a 2 baboon headed creature with tentacles surrounding it. This creature in the mural is looking at the crystal. The crystal looks cracked in 4 places and doesn’t look complete. Detect magic is detecting all schools of magic. 

Izan takes the crystal and as he does the room shakes and we hear a creepy voice in our heads that says “Intruder!”. Many creatures (Rutterkin) emerge from the spikes and start attacking us. We escape and the temple collapses. 

Izan gives each of us 1 piece of the crystal. We collect the provisions and return to Farmer’s Nook.

[[Gelda]] and Fred reveal that it wasn’t just the horde of bugbears that were affecting their town. They worshiped Kael, and they were prosperous. A family came to their town and blessed them. They were revered as chosen ones. This young family was slaughtered by the townsfolks after the townsfolk became jealous of them. This group of townsfolk became evil and started talking about power and gems. They corrupted many of the townsfolk into following their beliefs. They twisted the gospel of Kael into something evil. Their leader was a tall human, pale skin, charismatic, named Kraskus.

The child of the chosen ones escapes while they burned his parents. They call the child the missing piece. The evil group called the “[[Children of the Sky]]” tried to go after the child.

The chosen ones all had the image of a topaz gem on the palms of their hands. So the parents died, which gave them 4 gems (1 from each palm of the parent’s hands). Presumably they are missing 2 gems, which is why the child is referred to as the missing piece.
