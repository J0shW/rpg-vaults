## 14th of Growth
Just traveling the desert

## 15th of Growth
### Nox Album
Nox Album is a celebration in Trapazia. It's a celebration of the night. Businesses are open all night, and people party throughout the night. It is also a religious holiday celebrating the god [[Ostella]].

We see 7 bright moons light up the sky. Normally we cannot see them all at once.

[[Kilikar]] calls this celebration "The night of the creator". Common to share what we've done the past year. To see where we've come from and make sure we are going the right direction.

### Sharing Circle
[[Kilikar]] - One year ago he was still in the cage we found him in. 
[[Izan]] - 
[[Grimsby]] - Was with the beavers after losing their university job
[[Jasper]] - One year ago found the Quill and discovered his father was missing
[[Harper]] - On Caspian's yacht

## 16th of Growth
[[Kilikar]] finds a cave to sleep in.
The cave has red crystals jutting out of the walls. There is also a pond in the cave. And some remnants of creatures (bones, etc).

### Cave Battle
Fight some abominations
Then rest in cave

## 17th of Growth
We continue walking through the desert.
I notice beasts coming towards us.


## FUTURE
### Makoozi Tribe
