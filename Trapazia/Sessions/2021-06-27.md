### Nox Album
Nox Album is a celebration in Trapazia. It's a celebration of the night. Businesses are open all night, and people party throughout the night. It is also a religious holiday celebrating the god [[Ostella]].

We see 7 bright moons light up the sky. Normally we cannot see them all at once.

[[Kilikar]] calls this celebration "The night of the creator". Common to share what we've done the past year. To see where we've come from and make sure we are going the right direction.

### Sharing Circle
