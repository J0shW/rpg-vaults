Session Note: Calvin showed up to the discord call today in a real life [[Izen]] mask! It looks so sick and really creepy. Steven randomly saw it on Etsy and gifted it to Calvin!

## 14th of Growth
Just traveling the desert. We are still a few days away from arriving at the [[Makoozi Tribe]].

## 15th of Growth
### Nox Album
[[Nox Album]] is a celebration in Trapazia. It's a celebration of the night. Businesses are open all night, and people party throughout the night. It is also a religious holiday celebrating the god [[Ostella]].

We see 7 bright moons light up the sky. Normally we cannot see them all at once.

[[Kilikar]] calls this celebration "The night of the creator". Common to share what we've done the past year. To see where we've come from and make sure we are going the right direction.

### Sharing Circle
[[Kilikar]] - One year ago he was still in the cage we found him in. 
[[Izan]] - 
[[Grimsby]] - Was with the beavers after losing their university job
[[Jasper]] - One year ago found the Quill and discovered his father was missing
[[Harper]] - On Caspian's yacht

## 16th of Growth
[[Kilikar]] finds a cave to sleep in that might provide a more restful sleep. Hopefully allowing us to get a long rest (The open desert prevented us from doing a long rest). [[Harper]] does not want to risk the cave, but we convince her.
The cave has red crystals jutting out of the walls. There is also a pond in the cave. And some remnants of creatures (bones, etc).

[[Harper]] and [[Grimsby]] take a swim in the pond.
[[Jasper]] tries to break off a piece of crystal to examine. He fails. But as he walks back to the pond he hears a voice say "So lonely ... want friends"

### Desert Cave Battle
An abomination crawls out of a hole near [[Jasper]]. It is grotesque with many spiky arms. Another crawls out of a second hole on the opposite side of the cave. We quickly dispatch of one of the creatures. But the second one is able to squeeze [[Harper]] with its spiked arms, knocking her out completely.

[[Izen]] is able to kill the second one. [[Jasper]] quickly runs up to [[Harper]] and heals her. [[Harper]] is not very happy that we came to this cave.

We then take a long rest, but [[Izen]], [[Grimsby]], and [[Jasper]] still take a level of exhaustion from the previous day.

## 17th of Growth
We continue walking through the desert.
I notice beasts coming towards us. I alert everyone and we decide to try to hide. [[Izen]], [[Grimsby]], and [[Harper]] get under our towels, while [[Kilikar]] and [[Jasper]] cover the towels with sand. [[Kilikar]] and [[Jasper]] then use their invisibility to hide.

[[Harper]] makes a sound though and the creatures become aware of us.

We then have a battle with 2 Giant humanoid Scorpions. As [[Harper]] kills the last one, her Wild Magic causes her to lose all of her hair!

End of session.
