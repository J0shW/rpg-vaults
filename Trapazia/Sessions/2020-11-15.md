# `fas:PenNib` Session 5: November 15, 2020
---

We are awoken by a small Fey creature who puts shaving cream on my face and Grimsby has writing on his face. Harper has oil at the foot of the bed that she slips on. The creature scurries away.

We find Izan in the courtyard singing a tune with his guitar.

[[Wayra]] messages me and tells me the city is open again.

We pack up and head back to [[Adelgate]]. We don’t encounter anything on our way to the city.
The city gates are open. We arrive on the 12th of Birth.

A town crier tells us about the attempted kidnapping of [[Xari Fassul]] from [[Port Valoor]] Was thwarted. 
Being kidnapped by pirates, but was thwarted by a group of 4 individuals. She was a member of the royal family. Lizardfolk royal family that runs [[Maldobrine]]. The 2 cities, Port Valoor and Maldobrine are 2 of the most prominent cities in Trapazia. 

[[Scrivener's Guild]] - Old structure looks like a mini castle, brick and tall windows.

[[Vari]] greets us. They are new at the guild. They direct us to Lionel’s office.

[[Lionel]] is a stout dwarf. Wrinkles for days. Nice suit and vest. Massive cigar in his mouth. He encourages me to write a book of adventures!

We then head to the River Guards Building to meet [[Fez]] and [[Oslo]]. We tell Oslo we fixed the Farmer’s Nook situation. 

Oslo tells Izan that he has a performance booked for him on the 20th of Birth (in 8 days) at the [[Singing Mistress]]. At the beginning of the Bloom Festival. Street Vendors, Flower sculptures, flower competition, games, etc.

Adelgate has a lot of big buildings with no personality. Very corporate. Think of New York.

[[Hanna Quid]] runs the Singing Mistress, she is an older Tiefling woman. Izan and Harper get rooms at the Singing Mistress. Grimsby wants to have a sleepover at my apartment at the scrivener’s guild.

We met up at the Singing Mistress on the 20th of Birth for Izan’s performance. Izan meets [[Patricio Lamell]], a teenage peasant musician, who is an annoying brat. Izan then does his performance of “You dig a hole, I’ll build a wall” (from the game Bastion).

At the end of his song, Patricio stands up in the crowd and challenges Izan to a ‘Dueling Duet’. Someone starts a tune, then the next person takes over. It goes back and forth 3 times. Best performance wins. And at the end of it Izan won!
