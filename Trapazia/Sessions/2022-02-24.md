## 44th of Growth

### Town
[[Izen]] goes to some mysterious house?

We go to see [[Nadia Biz]] at the [[Desert Rose]] tavern.

Nadia has a half-elven female Manager named, [[Hala]].
Hala is very skeptical of us. protective of Nadia. Hala gets us 5 VIP pass to the [[Valcordum Festival]].

[[Jasper]] is expected to interview Nadia on the spot and he  is a bit taken aback.
Nadia grew up as Rederick Bastion was their birth name. Dreams as a young boy to be a singer. Not many auditions. Started dressing as a woman and got much more attention. Soon meets [[Hala]] and starts working together. Drag. Has a celebrity crush on [[Zed Leppelin]]

[[Harper]] suggests to Nadia to start a show where she teaches other people her craft.
We leave Nadia's. Izen stops Hala and asks her to get him a gig in the [[Valcordum Festival]]. She says she cant do it. Izen then cats Suggestion on her and she agrees to get him a spot in the lineup.

Izen and Jasper find a spot to sit outside and start making posters for his show.

Harper, Grimsby and [[Krinqwok]] go to find [[Herb's Herbs]] storefront. He sells weed. Krinqwok buys some weed. Krinqwok gives Herbs some Yakra bulbs? They are like a soft purple garlic bulb that's been split in half. All 3 of them get really buzzed from breathing the second hand weed from the shop. They leave and get lost on their way back while handing out weed to people on the street to tell them to come to Izen's show.

Jasper makes some amazing posters for Izen

Izen, Harper, Grimsby and Krinqwok make a distraction, while Jasper turns invisible, sneaks into the port authority building and finds the master shipping log.

The ship is called the Dawn Voyager, stored at lot number 16. We make our way near it and decide to sneak out way towards it, hiding behind barrels and things.
