# `fas:PenNib` Session 8: January 3, 2021
---

We decided to run from the gnoll ambush. After some tense stealth checks we think we are in the clear. 

[[Popper Chaddletop]] is the gnome with the construct (named Buddy)
The gnome heads back to Adelgate

We continue onward in the carriage for a few days. We enter a dense fog which envelops the carriage.The fog clears and we are now in a thick snowfall. The carriage halts on the harsh terrain. The axel seems to be frozen.

# 38th of Birth
We fight some Ice Mephits and some wolves. We get back in the carriage and leave this strange frozen area and enter a desert and finally come upon [[Mahrez]], a small desert town. It is the 38th of birth.

I buy some studded leather armor that I can pick up in 2 days from the Anvil shop (owner named Ferrick). Izan is also getting his Guitar repaired here.

Next we go to [[Pashaâ€™s Pile]], local magic shop. Items are too expensive. But Izan strikes up a deal with [[Pasha]] to teach him some new spells.

There is an inn called the [[Sleepy Jackal]] and a tavern called the [[Sandy Dune]]. The Sandy Dune is covered in posters for [[Nadia Biz]], a performer.

Izan and Harper pull an elaborate scheme at the Sandy Dune to convince them to give us free stuff because Harper has a famous family, but it failed miserably.
