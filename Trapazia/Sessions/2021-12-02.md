## 27th of Growth

### Sleepy Jackal
The Sleepy Jackal is covered in tarps and scaffolding.
We see a person walking down the road toward us.
We meet [[Krinqwok]] Tortle with a glaive, very little clothing. He's like a TMNT surfer stoner dude.
He asks us about portals. He was told people at the sleepy jackal would know.

The owner of the Jackal doesn't want us in, especially Izen.
We charm him to talk to us.
[[Bashir]] is the owner of the [[Sleepy Jackal]]
Turns out after we stole everything from the auction, the halflings that were there came to the Sleepy Jackal because Izen had posters of his face up here for one of his concerts. The halflings destroyed and burnt the Sleepy Jackal in search of Izen because we stole their auction item.

Auction items:
Imp Bones, Corpse Flower, Vintage Wine, Terrabomb

We go to the [[Sandy Dune]] tavern
The inn keeper is [[Heli]]

Harper takes a bath.
Jasper makes Izen some new posters for his concert with his calligraphy kit.

Izen is going to hold a show here tomorrow night to lure the halflings here so we can have a little chat.

Jasper gets a message in his head from [[Wayra]], she tells him that Jasper's rival in the journalist community [[Eileen Chavi]] has broken some big news in Adelgate. She says the escaped assassins from the failed hanging in [[Adelgate]] seems to be a coordinated inside job by high ranking officials inside the adelgate government.

They wouldn't  have been able to escape without help from the inside.

Adelgate council - 6 members, one went missing 4 left
We saw the 4 at both the execution and at the bloom festival

Adelgate Council:
Emperor Vincent Kamp (Male Dragonborn - dead)
Duke Garrion Fischer (Male Half-elf - missing)
Duchess Maria Corso (Female Half-orc)
Duchess Kasha Sariz (Female Halfling)
Duke Samuel Casikiri (Male Elf)
Duke Artimes Pastor (Male Human)

Others:
Osira Bazkar (Female Goliath) - River Guard
Fez Mayore (Male Halfling) - Detective
Oslo Waltzig (Male Elf)

We then play 2 truths and a lie. Losers have to hit [[Krinqwok]]'s dank weed. Jasper just sips water instead.

We go to the gathering of tents on the outside of town to help [[Krinqwok]] ask folks about if they know anything about portals. We hand out some of Izen's posters also.
