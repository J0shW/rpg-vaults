## ??th of Growth

Paulucrin turns into a little girl. We suggest it to turn back into its frog form. Guards escort us and the creature to the palace.

### The Palace
4 thrones:
Left - young boy, properly dressed, in awe of the creature
Next is an older man, Pandrin, stern stoic.
Then Yulia, the mother, softer and stoic face
Lastly, princess [[Xari Fassul]], having none of this, doesn't want to be there.

[[Oslo]], the elf from Adelgate is there.

Oslo leads us to the central keep outside the royal palace. Oslo is an assistant to detective [[Fez]].

Oslo travels around Adelgate gathering information for Fez.

If we would like to pursue a partnership with Oslo and his network of information, meet him at [[The Gypsy's Gaze]] tomorrow.

The royal court has gifted us a lavish home in the Central Keep.
We go there to get some sleep.

Jasper's Quill stops writing so scratchily. Whatever event occurred seems to have subsided.

### Izen's Dream
Izen sees [[Robin Goodfellow]] and [[Jawree]]
