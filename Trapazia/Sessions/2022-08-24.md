## 45th of Growth

Paulucrin turns into a little girl. We suggest it to turn back into its frog form. Guards escort us and the creature to the palace.

### The Palace
4 thrones:
Left - young boy, properly dressed, in awe of the creature
Next is an older man, Pandrin, stern stoic.
Then Yulia, the mother, softer and stoic face
Lastly, princess [[Xari Fassul]], having none of this, doesn't want to be there.

[[Oslo]], the elf from Adelgate is there.

Oslo leads us to the central keep outside the royal palace. Oslo is an assistant to detective [[Fez]].

Oslo travels around Adelgate gathering information for Fez.

If we would like to pursue a partnership with Oslo and his network of information, meet him at [[The Gypsy's Gaze]] tomorrow.

The royal court has gifted us a lavish home in the Central Keep.
We go there to get some sleep.

Jasper's Quill stops writing so scratchily. Whatever event occurred seems to have subsided.

### Izen's Dream
Izen has a dream and sees [[Robin Goodfellow]] and [[Jawree]], but Izen is not Izen, he is [[Bartolo]] and he is not wearing the mask.

Robin says he has an Anchor, the only to free himself from the mask is to break the Anchor. He says that in this dream state they are in the mask. The Mask is like a parasite. Without a host the parasite dies. Unfortunately Jawree is a part of the mask. Robin says he can remove the mask, but Jawree would be trapped in the mask and would slowly die. He would go back to being Bartolo, but Jawree would be consumed by madness.

Robin and Jawree seem to know Bartolo, but Bartolo doesn't seem to remember clearly who they are. Robin says the Mask is called the [[Crying Mask of Cascardia]]. It has been passed down by many many people and Bartolo is Just the most recent wearer. Jawree is here with the Evil Anchor, the Gross One.

They suddenly feel the ground shake and a Baboon cackle in the distance. Bartolo seems to recognize it, then wakes up suddenly in his bed.
