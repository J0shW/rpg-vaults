## ??th of Growth

### Closing the Portal
- We kill the remaining minion enemies
- [[Jawree]] finds a black orb in his belongings that can close the portal
- [[Izan]] takes the black orb and uses Dimension Door to teleport next to the portal. He starts to insert the orb, but his mind becomes cloudy as a large menacing being casts Dominate Person on him. Izan is now thralled by the evil being.
- [[Jasper]] turns invisible and [[Harper]] drops the wall of fire. 
- We start having to make wisdom saves at the start of each of our turns. If we fail we try to melee attack an ally around us and lose our action for the turn.
- We fight him as best we can
- I try to sleight of hand the orb from Izan but I lost my action for the turn
- [[Grimsby]] used dispell magic to free Izan from the beings thrall
- [[Izan]] is now [[Bartolo]] he has no idea whats going on
- [[Jasper]] takes the orb from [[Bartolo]] and tries to get to the door
- The evil being knocks [[Jasper]] unconscious with his spear
- We kill the being
- [[Jasper]] is revived
- [[Kilikar]] takes the orb and inserts it into the portal

### Origins of the mask?
We all become spectral once again
- [[Jawree]] is standing were kilikar was and is inserting the orb into the portal
- Everything starts getting sucked into the black orb like a black hole
- The tower is shaking violently
- [[Jawree]] in a panic runs to his desk and pulls out a white mask
- He puts it on and his life force starts being sucked into it. 
- I think he knows the orb is going to destroy everything and he is trying to preserve himself in the mask
- A tentacle from the portal grabs [[Jawree]] and now both blue life energy from Jawree and purple dark magical energy from the tentacle are being sucked into the mask.
- The tentacle gets cut off and both it and Jawree are consumed by the mask and it drops onto the floor.
- THE MASK NOW LOOKS IDENTICAL TO [[Izen]]'s MASK!!!

### Waking up
- Everything fades to black
- We hear a voice it is not the Sphinx
- "Your trial is done" "HIstory is made by those in the present" "We definitely changed history for those in [[Cascardia]]" "Some things can't be changes"
- "I have been watching your journey and all I can tell you is this: Wary are those who cannot distinguish friend from foe"

- We awake on a hill on the outskirts of [[Mahrez]]
- [[Izen]] is himself again, he doesn't remember what happened
- We explain what we saw with [[Jawree]] and his mask
- We discuss where our journey should take us next
- We decide to venture to [[Port Valoor]] to return the letter to [[Marsden]], return the auction items, and hope to learn more about [[Izen]] and the mask while we're there.
