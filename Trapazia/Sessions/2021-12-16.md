### The Bazaar

The gang goes to the [[Travellerâ€™s Bazaar]] to get some masks to hide their identities
[[Krinqwok]] gets a grass mask
[[Grimsby]] gets a goat mask
[[Jasper]] gets a wolf mask
[[Harper]] gets a Venetian mask

Jasper gets a new grey suit.
Harper gets a sleek black dress.

### The Show
Its the time for Izan's show at the [[Sandy Dune]]

People we know show up
[[Roker Lee]]
[[Wendy Harkin]]
[[Jipple]]
[[Pasha]]

Izan sees [[Cazia Parovsky]] and she tells him [[The Syndicate]] is asking to see him.

Grimsby uses the goat bag to make a rat appear.
Izen starts his show.

[[Robin Goodfellow]] appears in Grimsby's rat and tells us that he can confirm that [[Jawree]] is inside of Izen's mask.

No halflings show up that night.

Jasper talks to Roker and Wendy. They don't know where to find the halflings we are looking for.

We sleep on cots at the Sandy Dune

The next day Grimsby tells Izen about Jawree being in the mask.
