## 28th of Growth

### The Bazaar
We wake up in our tent on the outskirts of town

The gang goes to the [[Travellerâ€™s Bazaar]] to get some masks to hide their identities
[[Krinqwok]] gets a grass mask
[[Grimsby]] gets a goat mask
[[Jasper]] gets a wolf mask
[[Harper]] gets a Venetian mask

Jasper gets a new grey suit.
Harper gets a sleek black dress.

### The Show
Its the time for Izan's show at the [[Sandy Dune]]

People we know show up
[[Roker Lee]]
[[Wendy Harkin]]
[[Jipple]]
[[Pasha]]

Izan sees [[Cazia Parovsky]] and she tells him [[The Syndicate]] is asking to see him.

Grimsby uses the goat bag to make a rat appear.
Izen starts his show.

[[Robin Goodfellow]] appears in Grimsby's rat and tells us that he can confirm that [[Jawree]] is inside of Izen's mask.

No halflings show up that night.

Jasper talks to Roker and Wendy. They don't know where to find the halflings we are looking for.

We sleep on cots at the Sandy Dune

## 29th of Growth
The next day Grimsby tells Izen about Jawree being in the mask.

### Sheffield & Co
We go to [[Sheffield & Co]] to get a carriage to [[Port Valoor]]
[[Garson]] is the worker there. He says there is a driver who can take us to Port Valoor. [[Richard]] the driver is not excited to see us since we almost got him killed last time.

Izen wants to talk to [[Ernest]], but he is not here. He is at The Sheffield & Co headquarters is in [[Shep Shed]] which is a small town in the [[Adelcrest Forest]].

We hop into the carriage. Normally takes 18 days, but only takes us 14 in the carriage. Our trip is very uneventful, the temperature becomes much more bearable and humid.

We arrive in [[Port Valoor]] on the 43rd of Growth.

## 43rd of Growth
Adelgate was built like a fortress with a wall. [[Port Valoor]] bleeds into its outskirts much more naturally. Bohemian feel. Music and food on every corner.
