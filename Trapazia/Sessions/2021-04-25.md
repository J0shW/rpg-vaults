## 1st of Birth
### Identifying the Auction Items
Imp Bones, Flower and Wine are all non-magical

[[The Orb]] is magical in nature. There is something even the identify spell can't extract. It has a foreign arcana. There are shifting pieces like a puzzle. I try to solve it, but I fail.

Grimsby is able to identify the trigger mechanism. We decide to go outside to test it. We stand back and Grimsby activates it. It beeps rapidly a few times, Izan grabs Grimsby and Dimension Doors them to safety. The Orb explodes. 

The explosion seems to harness elemental energy from nowhere, It explodes with fire in a 10ft radius. It looks identical to the explosion when the hangings were interrupted at the very start of the campaign.

Dream of a cage, light, shade, arms hurting, mouth hurting, and an oppressive heat. We all awake in a cage, in tattered clothes, our wrists had been bound, but are now freed. There is a fifth person in the cage with us, they are a bipedal insect creature. We are in a tent full of many cages. Some of the creatures in the other cages are a Gnoll, a Kobold, a Kenku, and a mixture of others.

The insect creature, [[Kilikar]] tells us we are in a place called Zaphra. He points at the entrance of the tent, were 2 Jackalweres are standing guard. They are collecting fighters, for their enjoyment. The Avatar brought us here. The Avatar is a Sphinx.

We also see a hairy torn up creature like a yeti in another cage. It looks feral. He has been here the longest, and is the best fighter.

[[Kilikar]] has a plan. They are most vulnerable after an event. The event will happen tonight. We will escape after the event.

Then our cage starts to move as we realise we are on wheels and we are pulled into darkness, then the cage opens and we walk into an open arena.

The audience is all Jackalweres, hundreds of them. There are bones, blood, corpses, and broken columns strewn about.

We see a Sphinx observing us from the crowd. It asks us to kneel, Izan and Harper disobey, I convince them to comply for now. The Sphinx gives a signal and other gates open.

We run to the center to retrieve our equipment. Kilikar grabs a bo-staff with blades on both ends and some shurikens, then he casts a spell to blur himself and is hard to perceive clearly.

We fight 3 giant scorpions and dispatch of them quickly. Then the next round 2 more cages open and 2 Hyenas and a Chimera emerge.
