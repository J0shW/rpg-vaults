# February 21, 2021
We arrived in [[Mahrez]] on the 38th. 

[[Eliza Poffrin]] - Her family makes fashion for balls and ceremonies.

Everyone is talking about Harper in [[Fazerithein]].

Eliza invites Harper and Izan to [[Nadia Biz]]’s show tomorrow night.

  

Harper goes to the Traveller’s Bazaar, which is a mess  of shops that line a street. She buys way too much clothing.

  

Talk to merchants on the street: Lots about the dessert, the Ezriki foothills. Lot of talk of tribes in the Pirilago dessert. Need escort for going into the dessert. Wayfinders in a tribe are individuals that can travel using the stars with extreme accuracy. There’s a belief in these tribes of Sphinxes living in the dessert. A traditional of reaching adulthood is to find a sphinx and pass its trials.

  

I run up to Harper and tell her all about the stories I heard from the townspeople of the bazaar. She takes me to a shop to help me find a new outfit for the concert.

  

We go to the show that evening.

  

Nadia Biz is a larger purple skinned tiefling. She starts singing. (Steven plays Rupauls songs) I notice the performer has an Adam’s Apple. She’s a Drag Queen!

  

At that moment I hear a panicked scream. I follow the scream outside. On a hill I see humanoids running down this hill. They are Jackal type creatures and there are also some insect like creatures. We start a battle with Rupaul playing in the background.

  

We defeat the Jackalweres. Nadia Biz thanks us and asks us to look into a friend of hers that died recently in Mahrez. Nadia wants us to investigate the crime.

  

Lorali Felzwin is the friend that died. Roker Lee is head of the town guard.

  

Nadia Biz also invites us to visit her anytime in Port Valoor. (At a tavern with the logo of a woman in a rose)

  

The next day we go to Loreli’s apartment. I use Knock on the lock. It opens, we find inside a picture of Loreli with a man named Joffrey. There was a love between Loreli and Joffrey. There are knitting needles around. Maybe a seamstress. 

  

I spoke to the downstairs tenant. She said that Loreli worked at the Bazaar. And that Joffrey came around sometimes and wasn’t a pleasant man. 

  

Me and Izan start heading to speak with Roker at the town guard. While Grimssby and Harper head to the Bazaar. Robin mentioned that maybe we could try speaking with the dead woman? Hint hint -- I know Speak with the Dead using my Quill of Oratio.
