[[Harper]] Throne - Quinn

[[Adelgate]] - Starting City (Bustling Metropolis)

City is surrounded by the [[Central Plains]]

Here to cover a story. The first public execution performed since the death of the royal family, over 60 years ago.

Wooden stage with 3 noosed individuals. 4 well dressed people off to the side. Varying guards.

Female half-orc is running the show

The 3 noosed individuals are accused of kidnapping and killing?:
- Duke garion fischer
- Edmund vincent camp
- ?

The Accused:
- Male halfling -left
- Male Half-orc -Center
- Female Dwarf -right

Insect creatures burst from the ground

Vicious Mockery:
The creature was revolting. The gods must have been in a particularly bad mood when they created it. What a sad existence it must have.

Used Tongues, but the creature didn’t speak any languages.

 
Kendel 
- Lady who lost her friend

Roger Pseudonym for Izan -Calvin
Crimsby Pseudonym for Grimsby -Rita

We enter the hole in the ground the insects created.
Tunnel splits into a ladder upward and a hole continues downward.
The ladder leads to a trapdoor that opens into a field outside the city.

I suspect this is the way the accused escaped. But we decide to follow the tunnel lower, assuming this is where Kendel was taken.

We encounter a room full of eggs. Inside the eggs:
Long scorpion-like pincer legs, furry body like a tarantula, with a worm-like neck and head with sharp teeth.

2 massive cages:
A male human and young female tiefling in one
An assortment of other creatures in the other, including Kendel

We escape the cave but 2 scorpion worm creature things follow us out the trapdoor above the ladder. We have a short battle. Harper’s Wild Magic Surge saved us.
