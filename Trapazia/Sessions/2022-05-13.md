## 44th of Growth

### Mind Probe
Jasper calms Barret and puts him to bed in his room.
Jasper then finds Izen and in a rage and rushes him, shaking him, asking him to bring out [[Bartolo]] or [[The Mask]]. One of them must know something about [[Cassandra Flint]]'s death.
Izen says he can't just bring them out, but he persuades the mask to speak to him in a mirror despite Jasper being in the room.
The mask wants to probe Barrett's mind to find the answers, he's hungry for memories.
Izen is worried that the mask will affect Barrett's mind, so he asks if it can probe Jasper's mind first so as to quell the mask's hunger.

The mask probe's Jaspers mind which shows both Jasper and Izen a flash of all the memories from Jasper's life.

REMINDER: Choose 3 events to share with Izen next session.

This leaves Izen and Jasper very exhausted, so they go to bed and decide to probe Barrett's mind later.

### Harper at the Bar
Harper tells Cazia her whole life story. About how she got her powers and that she's trying to do good deeds to get rid of them.

## 45th of Growth

### Barrett
She needed to write about things that weren't typically out in the open. This caused controversial articles about different organizations.

The last thing she wrote was about the syndicate. So he thought they were responsible for her disappearance.

A long time ago there was a writer called [[The Scribe of Trapazia]]. Nobody knew who they were. Had first had accounts about secret organizations and untouchable people.

A couple decades ago their writings just stopped. (Because of her disappearance)

Reports of [[The Veridian Scale]], the Delerin War (The royal families in maldobrine and port valoor), The Westcove Family Line, The Syndicate, the Division out of Osbourne, The Parsudo family.

Made a name of herself on the Delerin War and the Westcove familial line, then the Syndicate, The Veridian Scale

### Meeshka
We go to the Waterfront Inn in the New Port district to confront Meeshka and the Tranquil Blade to remove the hit contract on Izen.

Barrett and Jasper go in to try to find Meeshka
Clairvoyance - A shady group talks about moving something on the 47th of Growth.

Jasper talks to a drug dealer who sells him some drugs that he later gives to Krinqwok. 

He doesn't find Meeshka and asks Harper for help. She doesn't find her either, but does find Cazia he tells her that we shouldn't be here. She told Izen that she would handle the removal of the hit contract on Izen. He just forgot to tell us.

### Cassandra
We got to the Captain's Quarter Inn in Old Port to get a room for Barrett.
Barrett agrees to have his mind probed by Izen so that we can learn if he missed anything when Cassandra went missing all of those years ago.

As Barrett is kissing Cassandra goodbye, he sees a title that says "The Obsidian Eye" and "The Kings Eye".

Barrett and toddler Jasper go out for a treat on the town, when they return home, Cassandra is missing and the house is torn apart with the Quill on the ground.

Paper's strewn around of Cassandra's old writing. We see slash marks and tables broken. And large scratch marks from a claw. It seemed bipedal, and we see small hints of blood.

Then Barrett later becomes a recluse.
He takes an old article about the Syndicate with Izen circled. Goes into a forest, with glimpses of mountains that are snow-capped. He goes into Raven's Pub in Shep Shed, there is a deep gnome, clean-shaven, well-dressed, who slips Barrett a note. He then meets Meeshka in a cave. She is a tanned, tall, slender, human woman, that Izen recognizes.


We thank Barrett. Jasper leaves him some gold. And Jasper and Izen go to meet up with the rest of the party at the festival.

End of session.
