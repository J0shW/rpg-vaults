## 45th of Growth

### The Valcordum Festival
There is an open festival area with performers, fire-breathers, games, etc. There is also a blocked off concert area. We have VIP passes that [[Hala]] gave us. [[Harper]], [[Grimsby]] and [[Krinqwok]] enter the concert area to find the shops.

Shops:
Herb's Herbs
Ira's Fantastical market of Magic
Quattro's Carnales


### Ira's Fantastical Market of Magic
- Magical rope that can be cut and magically mends itself
- Jug that fills itself with any liquid - 250gp
- Bowler Hat that casts disguise self at will - 500gp
- Boots that can cast levitate at will - 2000gp

Grimsby buys the hat.

Izen and Jasper go to the backstage area of the concert.

Performers:
- Nadia Biz
- BTS
- Zed Lepellin
- Blavid Dane

 Jasper goes to talk to Blavid Dane. he is a panther black skinned Tabaxi with a deck of cards
	- salt and pepper whiskers
	- financial ruin
	- "introducing magic to a new generation"
	- doing magic for the love of it
	- gambling problem, drinking problem

Jasper sees Hala and asks her if she knows what Xari looks like.
[[Xari Fassul]] is a younger Tiefling with blue skin.

### Izen's Show
We all sit in the front row for Izen's show.
Izen sees someone named [[Viv]] in the crowd.
He starts the show.
As the song ends a backdrop falls with a sign that says:
"Coming soon, [[Bartolo]] Wei"

Hala knows Bartolo, she's his sister. Viv is Bartolo's wife!


### Nadia's Show
Jasper stays behind with Bartolo in his tent to look after him.

Grimsby, Harper, and Krinqwok go to Nadia's show.

Nadia introduces a friend of theirs:
"A hero of Port Valoor who had saved [[Xari Fassul]].""
A lanky female Firbolg named [[Liva]] with a bostaff.

Nadia starts her show. We hear a strange sound like thunder.
Now we see explosions and cannonball fire on the shoreline. 
Half of the guards at the show rip part of their armor off to reveal themselves as lizardfolk. The Veridian Scale is here!

End of session.
