## 46th of Growth

### The Quill
Jasper casts legend lore in the [[Quill]]. He sees a storybook play out in front of his eyes:
- A quill picked up my young elven woman
- quill levitates as if enchanted
- was originally just a writing tool
- has seen a lot
- written many things
- has written iconic and important stories
- The Quills owner was widely recognized
- A moment where the quill changed
- The owner was someone bonded to the quill
- An element of the owner is in that quill
- Then the quill was given to you.
- The bonding of the quill to an owner was originally against its will.
- I believe that [[Cassandra Flint]] enchanted the Quill and somehow bonder herself to it and may now be trapped within it.

### Oslo Hunt
Jasper realizes that we were supposed to meet Oslo last night at [[The Gypsy's Gaze]]. Jasper rushes there in the morning and the barkeep tells him he's gone now. We leave a message with her if he returns.

### Herbs Herbs
[[Krinqwok]] gets more supplies from Herb's herbs

### The Ship
Go to Sheffield & Co's dock for passenger transport to Fayrun. Yes they have water travel also! Our captain named Romero is very enthusiastic. Izan is invisible while we leave and hides in a cabin while we sail to Fayrun.

### Fayrun
We arrive at a cliff face against the ocean called the Falling Cliffs. Then beyond them a heavily fortified structure built into the cliffs. Our ship is hoisted by a mechanism up into the city. There is a spire that's heavily fortified. It's very reminiscent of Cascardia where Jawree is from. Walking through the city we see a construct made of the red crystal that we saw in the cave in the Pirilago desert. The is a building called The Archive, which is the greatest library in Trapazia. The city is very technologically advanced.
