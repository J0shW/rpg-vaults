## ??th of Growth

### The Cave in the Cliffs
navigate cave
find chalk
fight beholder
collect chalk
return chalk to [[Jawree]]
get sent again to another point in time
appear inside a tower
see a much older [[Jawree]]
we appear as spectral beings
Jawree chants a spell and symbols light up around an archway
a blue portal appears in the archway
the portal turns purple
tentacles come out of the portal and grab him
creatures that we recognize appear from the portal
they are the beings from the underground temple where we took the crystals from
![[Pasted image 20211014212708.png]]

We fight the creatures and [[Harper]] casts a really clutch Wall of Fire to separate the creatures from us. We revive [[Jawree]] and debate whether to close the portal or not. 

The creatures start coming through the wall of fire. We defeat a few of them.

We hear a loud noise as what sounds like a huge creature has come through the portal. Oops, should've closed it :)

End of session.
