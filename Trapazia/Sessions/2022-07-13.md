Paulucrin - the Toad
From [[Maldobrine]] but currently living in the [[Pevallian Swamp]].
The halflings from [[Ausburn]] gave him the technology to control the weather.

The Node Orbs allow you to control the weather in a given area. The Controller is a device that goes in a creature's neck allowing them to control the weather within the Node area. Paulucrin has a controller in his neck.

We collect some of the nodes that the lizardfolk have placed around the dock.

He gives us a location in Maldobrine where we can meet someone who can guide us into the swamp.

## 3 Memories of Jasper's
1. Jasper as a young kid, sleuthing out a mystery during his school years
2. Having a big fight with his father over his desire to go to Adelgate and become a Scrivener
3. Meeting his mentor who helps him crack his first big story that impresses the guild and gets him membership to the Scriveners Guild (old Satyr named, Cid, known for being gruff. An outcast from the guild because taking on big stories that threaten the upper class, but never pan out.)
