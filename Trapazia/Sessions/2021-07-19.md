## The [[Makoozi Tribe]]

I notice tents
surrounded by a green oak tree

We see other's like Kilikar, bug-like.
One of them hugs [[Kilikar]] excitedly, [[Nyara]], his partner.

There is an immaculate oasis, a creek that wraps around a rick ridge that the oak tree stands on.
It looks out of place. As we enter the green space we feel a cool breeze and we feel like we are in the plains again.

On the ridge we see a smaller insect creature, older in years. [[Ree'ayko]]

They were nomadic, but when they happened upon this oasis they decided to stay.

Harper asks me to try to take the Mirror from Izan. We get it and Harper hides it in the Bag of Holding.

The oasis looks like it was cut directly out of the Inner plains somewhere. 
Similar in landscape to Adelgate, Cattlestok, Farmer's Nook area trees

Grimsby sees that the creek start flowing out of nowhere. There is the sand of the desert and then there is a hard line where the oasis begins. The creek start flowing out of nowhere.

Grimsby starts digging where the creek begins and finds another orb similar to he explodey ball we found in [[Mahrez]]

We can't seem to activate it in any way. 

[[Grimsby]] remembers the scroll we got from the statue in the Jackalwere camp. They start reading it
