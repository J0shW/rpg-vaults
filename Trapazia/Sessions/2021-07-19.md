## The [[Makoozi Tribe]]

I notice tents
surrounded by a green oak tree

We see other's like Kilikar, bug-like.
One of them hugs [[Kilikar]] excitedly, [[Nyara]], his partner.

There is an immaculate oasis, a creek that wraps around a rick ridge that the oak tree stands on.
It looks out of place. As we enter the green space we feel a cool breeze and we feel like we are in the plains again.

On the ridge we see a smaller insect creature, older in years. [[Ree'ayko]]

They were nomadic, but when they happened upon this oasis they decided to stay.

Harper asks me to try to take the Mirror from Izan. We get it and Harper hides it in the Bag of Holding.

The oasis looks like it was cut directly out of the Inner plains somewhere. 
Similar in landscape to Adelgate, Cattlestok, Farmer's Nook area trees

Grimsby sees that the creek start flowing out of nowhere. There is the sand of the desert and then there is a hard line where the oasis begins. The creek start flowing out of nowhere.

Grimsby starts digging where the creek begins and finds another orb similar to he explodey ball we found in [[Mahrez]]

We can't seem to activate it in any way. 

[[Grimsby]] remembers the scroll we got from the statue in the Jackalwere camp. They start reading it and words appear. They seem to be gibberish, but he can understand them. After reading for 10 minutes the words disappear and the scroll rolls up. Grimsby has gained advantage on intelligence checks for the rest of the day.

[[Jasper]] asks Ryako about the Sphinxes
- Sphinxes are viewed as avatars of the Creator
- Ostella - the god of healing and of starlight
- The sphinxes are their to test their people
- Their warriors seek out sphinxes to prove themselves.
- No one from this tribe has seen one. But Ryako's mother has seen one.
- Wayfinder's are people who read the stars to navigate.

[[Izan]] awakens after sleeping for 2 days. He plays a song, and the whole tribe gathered to listen.

[[Grimsby]] studies the new Orb again, and figures out that it's meant to store energy. But also that there is something missing. Grimsby digs some more and finds 3 more orbs at the other corners of the oasis.

We talk to [[Bartolo]], he tells us he's an actor from [[Port Valoor]]. Izan's body was all shriveled up and inhuman. But [[Bartolo]] took Izan's mask.

Who - Izan died, Bartollo saw it
What - 
Where - [[Port Valoor]], somewhere in the Old Port
When - A year ago
Why - In the alley to do business with Izan. There was another crime put upon his head and he went to appeal to Izan.

Sister named [[Hollaway]]
