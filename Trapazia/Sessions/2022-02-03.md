## 43rd of Growth

### A Unique Form of Gruesome
- The creature is from the abyssal plane
- We battle it and win
- [[Krinqwok]] uses detect portals and picks up the remnants of a portal that used to exist within the neighbouring forest south of us.
- Izen finds a ring of magical storage. He gives it to [[Jasper]] to add to his many ring collection.

### The Portal
We walk to the remnants of a portal. We hold the gems and scroll near each other and a portal opens up. We peek inside and see a horrible sight. The abyssal plane
- The ground is pulsing 
- Black ground
- Cries of agony and anger in the distance
We close it up again and return to the farm and leave a note for the farmer that the job is done. We return to the Syndicate and get a good nights sleep. [[Izen]] talk to his mask about the portal, but it didn't know much about the portal or the abyssal plane.

## 44th of Growth

[[Harper]] goes to the spa in the syndicate

[[Jasper]] want to learn more about [[Xari Fassul]]. There is a [[Port Valoor]] chapter of the [[Scrivener's Guild]].

[[Jasper]] and [[Harper]] talk to [[Cazia Parovsky]] at the Syndicate to ask about [[Xari Fassul]].
- [[Delarin]] war was fought between port valoor and maldobrine.
- The royal triumvirate ruled the land (port valoor, maldobrine, and adelgate)
- The familial line of adelgate ended. It was the adelgate family that kept the other two cities in check. With adelgate out, port valoor and maldobrine were in tension and a war started. It lasted for 2 years. Signed a West Cove Peace Treaty. The royal families have been on somewhat amicable terms. Ever since then there have been a group of Maldobrine people that think they need to fight for their independence and keep foreigners out. Critical of the maldobrine family for not being critical enough of port valoor. The group is called the [[Veridian Scale]]. They hired some pirates to kidnap [[Xari Fassul]]. It will probably happen again, but we don't know when or where. It happened in the old port district when she was in this area. Thrown into a ship, where the pirates would take her through the Delarin straight. Fortunately 4 people, the hired hands found themselves upon that ship and freed her. The 4 people were a part of the pirate group, but turned on their captain. We don't know why they stole the princess, maybe ransom, maybe start another war.
Xari is probably in the castle. But usually sneaks out to the [[Waterfront Inn]]
