## 44th of Growth

### The Dawn Voyager
We sneak our way to the ship. Harper, Grimsby and Krinqwok stay on deck as lookouts and to smoke up. Izen and Jasper go below deck to find the shipping log. They find the captains quarters, Jasper casts "Knock" on the door. It unlocks, but the floor opens up and Izen falls down next to a Gelatinous Cube! He quickly casts dimension door to teleport himself back up to the captains quarters.

Jasper picks the lock of a safe and finds:
1. 650gp
2. Shipping Log
3. Scroll - Map of Trapazia. Has words scrawled on the edges that say "Divine Fragments" and "Children of the Sky"
	
	Seven locations noted on the map
	- [[Jackal Island]]
	- [[Fayrun]] - crossed out
	- An arrow pointing to a circle in the [[Pirilago Desert]]
	- [[Suclidian Maw]]
	- [[Xallian Forest]]
	- Middle section of [[Adelcrest Forest]]
	- Middle section of the [[Crescent Range]]
	- The bay on the southern coast of Trapazia

[[Jasper]] also finds a Captain's jacket on the ship that he takes. Now he's truly a "Land Pirate"!

Izen starts the ship on fire. We leave the ship and get ambushed by 3 assassins. They nearly kill Izen. Krinqwok chases one but the assassin kills himself before he can be subdued. Harper polymorphs one into a sloth to be questioned later. The third assassin is tied up and we alert the guards to arrest him for burning the ship.

The assassins had a Tattoo of a feather crossed with a dagger in a circle.
