## 43th of Growth

### Port Valoor
We notice some flyers. It will be the Valcordum Festival of Music and Arts in 2 days. Celebration of entertainment and creative arts. Worship of [[Sacuren]], the Jester, and [[Partum]], the Creative Hand.

4 city districts:
- Old Port - Artsy
- New Port - Trade
- Royal District
- Ambrose District, bottom crescent, farms

We go to Quattro Carnales in the Old Port, a casual street-food restaurant. We have to seafood taco's on Izen's recommendation.

Tasks List:
- Somewhere to stay
- Give letter to [[Marsden]]
- Princess [[Xari Fassul]] was almost kidnapped from Port Valoor, thwarted by a group of 4
- Clear things up with Izen's employers

## Marsden
We head to the [[Caraval]] in New Port district. We meet [[Marsden]] at his fish market.

Marsden got payment even though Sasionel did not return. He also spied on one meeting with the employers. Hired by 3 people, half-orc, halfling and a dwarf. The half-orc was leading the conversation. They seemed calm, almost kind, respectful.

## The Syndicate
Then we head to the Old Port Bistro which is a restaurant which is a front for [[The Syndicate]]

We see a male half-orc in the kitchen who yells to someone. A human comes out and leads us to a table. But instead he leads us to a door that heads downward. Down a dark hallway we meet [[Cazia Parovsky]]. Izen goes off to talk to her, and the rest of us go to a lounge area with fireplaces and drinks.

Cazia leads Izen to his old office and asks him to sit. She asks him angrily what the heck was that scene that happened in [[Mahrez]], referring to the auction. Izen used to be in charge of the Syndicate??? and put Cazia in charge now. She is very sceptical of him because after the auction, Izen disappeared for weeks and couldn't be scried upon (because we were kidnapped).
