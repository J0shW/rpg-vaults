## 43th of Growth

### Port Valoor
We notice some flyers. It will be the [[Valcordum Festival]] of Music and Arts in 2 days. Celebration of entertainment and creative arts. Worship of [[Sacuren]], the Jester, and [[Partum]], the Creative Hand.

4 city districts:
- Old Port - Artsy
- New Port - Trade
- Royal District
- Ambrose District, bottom crescent, farms

We go to Quattro Carnales in the Old Port, a casual street-food restaurant. We have to seafood taco's on Izen's recommendation.

Tasks List:
- Somewhere to stay
- Give letter to [[Marsden]]
- Princess [[Xari Fassul]] was almost kidnapped from Port Valoor, thwarted by a group of 4
- Clear things up with Izen's employers

## Marsden
We head to the [[Caraval]] in New Port district. We meet [[Marsden]] at his fish market.

Marsden got payment even though Sasionel did not return. He also spied on one meeting with the employers. Hired by 3 people, half-orc, halfling and a dwarf. The half-orc was leading the conversation. They seemed calm, almost kind, respectful.

## The Syndicate
Then we head to the Old Port Bistro which is a restaurant which is a front for [[The Syndicate]]

We see a male half-orc in the kitchen who yells to someone. A human comes out and leads us to a table. But instead he leads us to a door that heads downward. Down a dark hallway we meet [[Cazia Parovsky]]. Izen goes off to talk to her, and the rest of us go to a lounge area with fireplaces and drinks.

Cazia leads Izen to his old office and asks him to sit. She asks him angrily what the heck was that scene that happened in [[Mahrez]], referring to the auction. Izen used to be in charge of the Syndicate??? and put Cazia in charge now. She is very sceptical of him because after the auction, Izen disappeared for weeks and couldn't be scried upon (because we were kidnapped).

Izen calls Jasper into the room and asks him to bring the bag of holding. Harper won't give Jasper the bag because she believes that Izen is after the [[Mirror]]. Cazia tells Izen that most of their relationships were not destroyed by the auction incident.

Don't have a good relationship with The Division or the Parsudo family.
- They are the ones who burnt down the Inn in Mahrez.
- The halflings' were the son and daughter of the Division's patriarch
- Son is [[Keppa]] and daughter is [[Keebla]]. 
- The Imp bones belonged to this Parsudo family.

Cazia aska Izen to take a job or two off of her hands:
1. Farmer that pays us for protection. His farm animals are disappearing at night.
2. One of the syndicates ship captains who sell stolen goods has been upselling their products and keeping the profit.
- Board the ship, find the ship log, determine if it is the correct ship, then burn it down.

We agree to do both jobs.

We take rickshaws to the edge of the Ambrose district to the farm.
We go to the farm house and meet a humanoid frog looking creature, older. 
We go to the barn and [[Krinqwok]] talks to the animals. he finds out that they were taken by 2 creatures. Insect-like, one with pincers, the other one was just big hulking brute. They killed Joe the Pig, who was a legend.

We hide outside the barn. Harper on the roof, Grimsby, Izen, and Jasper hide behind some troughs. Krinqwok goes inside his shell and we cover him with some hay.

Grimsby summons a goat from the goat bag to bait the monsters.

We wait in the darkness for the creatures to arrive.
