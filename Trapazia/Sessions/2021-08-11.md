## 26th of Growth

### The Storm
- Left the [[Makoozi Tribe]].
- Headed into the desert back to [[Mahrez]]
- On second day encountered some large beasts
- We also notice a sandstorm quickly coming toward us
- We fend off the beasts while running to a shelter we can see in the distance
- The storm overtakes us, pelting us with razor sharp sand
- But we make it to the shelter shortly after
- Turns out it is actually the prow of a ship jutting out of a dune

### The Ship
- We crawl  through a crack in the hull into the lower level of the ship to escape the growing sandstorm
- [[Harper]] finds some rum inside a barrel
- We head up to the second level of the ship
- [[Grimsby]] and [[Izan]] open up 2 door at once and we immediately start fighting some zombie like creatures with worms all over them
- More of them break through a door and start attacking
- Grimsby throws the [[Terra Bomb]] into one of the room and slams the door with a creature inside
- The bomb goes off, the creature dies, and we duck out of the way of the door as its propelled towards us
- We defeat the rest of the creatures

### The Captain
- Inside the captain's quarters at the back of the ship we find the body of a man, a locket, and a note
- A locket with a picture of a man with red hair in a ponytail and a beard.
- Handwritten note: To Marsden. From the Captain Sasionel
```
“My dearest Marsden, I hope that Alliga grants me this one last wish, and that this message finds you. The voyage has proven to be too much for our crew and our ship. We expected pirates, the storms that plague these waters, and even the dangerous creatures that call these waters their home. But we could not prepare for this… (writ-ing gets hurried) I must hurry, we don’t have much time. All I want you to know is that no matter what becomes of me, our paths will cross again, in this life or the next. Until that day, I love you with all my heart. Forever yours, Sasionel”
```

Alliga is the Mother of the Sea, the God of the Oceans

We contemplate how the ship got here into the middle of the desert and who this Sasionel could be.

[[Jasper]] thinks, well why don't we just ask him. And casts Speak with the Dead.

End of Session.
