## 43rd of Growth

### The Barn

After nightfall 4 crustacean like creatures appear, 1 being much bigger than the others. The spot us immediately in our hiding places. [[Jasper]] goes invisible but the creatures seem to still have an idea of where he is. [[Jasper]] casts tongues on one of them and asks how they are able to see him. They say because they can sense the magical items on him. 

[[Grimsby]] uses banishment on the big creature and it poofs out of existence for a minute. [[Krinqwok]] uses etherealness to transport himself through the ethereal plane and into the barn to hide.

[[Harper]] does tons of damage to the creatures from the rooftops.

We dispatch of the creatures and leave one to run away so we can follow it. We wait 30 seconds for the big creature to reappear and all target him simultaneously to quickly destroy him.

Grimsby gets his goat to follow the injured creature and instructs it to poop every so often so that we have a trail to follow.

We follow the creature to the mouth of a cave next to the shoreline. We short rest and have a discussion with [[Izen]] about what we should do with the [[Mirror]]. Either keep it on ourselves or take it to [[The Syndicate]] to keep in a secure vault.

We don't come to a decision yet. We continue into the cave. There are animal bones and carcasses strewn throughout.

Deep within the cave [[jasper]] can hear whimpers of a humanoid creature.

We enter a large cavern and see the humanoid creature curled up in a corner. [[Izen]] checks for traps and when it is deemed safe he throws a bone near the creature. It is not a helpless humanoid at all. The creature unfurls, standing 6 or 7 feet tall, its large jaw unhinged and screams at us. The long webbed claws of its spindly arms stretch out toward us.

End of session.
