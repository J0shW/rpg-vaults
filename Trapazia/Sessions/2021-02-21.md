# February 21, 2021
We arrived in [[Mahrez]] on the 38th. 

[[Eliza Poffrin]] - Her family makes fashion for balls and ceremonies.

Everyone is talking about Harper in [[Fazerithein]].

Eliza invites Harper and Izan to [[Nadia Biz]]’s show tomorrow night.

Harper goes to the [[Traveller’s Bazaar]], which is a mess  of shops that line a street. She buys way too much clothing.

Pod talks to merchants in the Bazaar: Lots about the dessert, the [[Ezriki foothills]]. Lot of talk of tribes in the [[Pirilago Desert]]. You need an escort when going into the dessert. **Wayfinders** in a tribe are individuals that can travel using the stars with extreme accuracy. There’s a belief in these tribes of **Sphinxes** living on the desert. A traditional of reaching adulthood is to find a sphinx and pass its trials and riddles.

Pod runs up to Harper and tells her all about the stories he heard from the townspeople in the bazaar. She takes him to a shop to help me find a new outfit for the concert.

We go to the Nadia Biz show that evening.
  
[[Nadia Biz]] is a larger purple skinned Tiefling. She starts singing. (Steven plays Rupaul's songs) I notice the performer has an Adam’s Apple. She’s a Drag Queen!

At that moment Pod hears a panicked scream. He follow the scream outside. On a hill he sees humanoids running down this hill. They are Jackal type creatures and there are also some insect like creatures. We start a battle with Rupaul's music playing in the background.

We defeat the Jackalweres. Nadia Biz thanks us and asks us to look into a friend of hers that died recently in Mahrez. Nadia wants us to investigate the crime.

[[Lorelei Felzwin]] is the friend that died. [[Roker Lee]] is head of the town guard.

Nadia Biz also invites us to visit her anytime in [[Port Valoor]]. (At a tavern with the logo of a woman in a rose)

The next day we go to Lorelei’s apartment. Pod uses Knock on the lock. It opens, we find inside a picture of Lorelei with a man named Joffrey. There was a love between Lorelei and Joffrey. There are knitting needles around. Maybe a seamstress. 

Pod spoke to the downstairs tenant. She said that Lorelei worked at the Bazaar. And that Joffrey came around sometimes and wasn’t a pleasant man. 

Pod and Izan start heading to speak with Roker at the town guard. While Grimsby and Harper head to the Bazaar to find seamstresses that may know Lorelei. Grimsby speaks to [[Robin Goodfellow]] through an animated portrait. He mentions that maybe we could try speaking with the dead woman? Hint hint -- Pod knows Speak with the Dead using my [[Quill of Oratio]].
