# `fas:PenNib` Session 6: December 06, 2020
---

After returning to his room, Izan finds a letter. You are cordially invited to [[Cazrick’s Curious Commodities]] on the first of Growth in the city of Mahrez on the edge of the Pirilago desert.
It is currently the 20th of Birth, each season has 50 days, so we have 30 days to get there. Another piece of paper falls out, [[Cazia Parovsky]] writes to Izan about an Item of extreme importance that will appear at this auction at [[Cazrick]]'s. 

We wake up to jubilant celebration with the Bloom festival starting. 

Flower sculptures include: Tarahm one of the dieties. [[Vincent Camp]] the deceased emperor.

We play a game where we have to identify a flower only by its scent. I earn 25 Gold for properly identifying all of the flowers.

The next game involves finding the proper flowers from a list on a little scavenger hunt. I pair up with Izan, and Grimsby and Harper are together.

We go to the [[Witches Cauldron]] Shop
Owned by [[Caz’ree]] the crazy gnome woman
Boots stealth 300gp
Bag with furry balls (bag of tricks) 500gp
Love potion 150gp


Grimsby cooks a lot of drugs. The Goliath and Tabaxi thugs that are demanding the drugs, bring Grimsby to [[Markus]]. Grimsby hands over the drugs and Markus demands another delivery next week. As Grimsby walks away he encounters a hooded figure. They reveal themselves to be an Elf with small elk horns and platinum blonde hair, this is [[Robin Goodfellow]]. He turns to Markus and tells him this deal is concluded, there will be no more deliveries demanded of Grimsby. Markus gets angry and grabs Robin. Robin snaps his fingers and transforms Markus, the goliath and Tabaxi into mice! 

On the last day of the bloom festival they announce a competition to get to the top of the Infinity tower. The winner gets a [[Nazri Stone]]. Nazri is the deity of knowledge (the knowing scholar). The stone fortifies the wielder’s leadership qualities.

Izan, Harper and Jasper start climbing the Infinity tower against the Captain of the River Guard, [[Bazcard]]. Izan wins! [[Maria Corzso]], the half-orc councilwoman running the event, gives Izan the Nazri Stone from the top of the tower. Izan asks Maria about the people that escaped from the hanging at the beginning of the campaign.
