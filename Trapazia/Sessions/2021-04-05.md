## 1st of Growth

### Izan's Reflection

Grimsby overhears [[Izan]] talking to himself in the mirror. 2 different voices are conversing. Bartollo? seems to be the real name of the person we know as Izan, but his mind is trapped in his subconscious and another entity is controlling him? Bartollo wants his freedom back. The parasitic entity controlling him agrees to letting him go if he can find another host.

The conversation ends. Izan attempts to carve into his mask with a knife, but an unseen force is stopping himself from doing so.

Grimsby comes and finds us later and tells us what he heard.
We agree to not let Izan know that we know.

### The Auction

Sun has now set, only moonlight. In a less populated part of town, surrounded by industrial buildings and factories. The address takes us down an alleyway. We encounter a large steel door. We knock, a slit opens in the door and someone asks us for our invitation. We are allowed to enter and are ushered in by 2 Duergar (Underdark Dwarves). They shine a blue light through the invitation and a glowing golden snitch-like symbol appears. He nods and lets us in.

We enter a brightly lit hall with spiral staircases on either side to a second story. Chandeliers above. Tables spread throughout. A stage area at the back. A few more Duergar walking about, and some nicer dressed individuals conversing.

[[Cazrick]] appears from a stage door. He is a dragonborn. 

Auction Items:
- Wooden stand with metal wiring containing bones which form a demonic imp creature. The remains of an imp from the planes of Hell.
- Crystal platter with a weird bulbous flower that hasn't flowered yet with blood red tips. A rare flower from the Jackal Island.
- Spherical orb slightly glowing blue from arcane energy. Unknown futuristic orb that pulses with magical energy.
- **A very old bottle of wine** - The very first bottle ever made of the Thorny Vine wine.

Grimsby spreads rumors in the crowd that the wine bottle is fake to hopefully lower the price.
