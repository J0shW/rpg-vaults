## 1st of Growth

### Izan's Reflection

Grimsby overhears [[Izan]] talking to himself in the mirror. 2 different voices are conversing. 
[[Bartollo]] and [[The Mask]] seem to be fighting for control over Izan's body. They are both controlling Izan. Bartollo wants his freedom back. The Mask entity controlling him agrees to letting him go if he can find another host.

The conversation ends. Izan attempts to carve into his mask with a knife, but an unseen force (The Mask) is stopping himself from doing so.

Grimsby comes and finds us later and tells us what he heard.
We agree to not let Izan know that we know.

### The Auction

Sun has now set, only moonlight. In a less populated part of town, surrounded by industrial buildings and factories. The address takes us down an alleyway. We encounter a large steel door. We knock, a slit opens in the door and someone asks us for our invitation. We are allowed to enter and are ushered in by 2 Duergar (Underdark Dwarves). They shine a blue light through the invitation and a glowing golden snitch-like symbol appears. He nods and lets us in.

We enter a brightly lit hall with spiral staircases on either side to a second story. Chandeliers above. Tables spread throughout. A stage area at the back. A few more Duergar walking about, and some nicer dressed individuals conversing.

[[Cazrick]] appears from a stage door. He is a dragonborn. 

Auction Items:
- Wooden stand with metal wiring containing bones which form a demonic imp creature. The remains of an imp from the planes of Hell.
- Crystal platter with a weird bulbous flower that hasn't flowered yet with blood red tips. A rare flower from the Jackal Island. Supposed to possess necrotic properties.
- **Spherical orb** slightly glowing blue from arcane energy. Unknown futuristic orb that pulses with magical energy.
- **A very old bottle of wine** - The very first bottle ever made of the Thorny Vine wine.

Grimsby spreads rumors in the crowd that the wine bottle is fake to hopefully lower the price. 

A battlescarred dwarf, [[Kebble]], is interested in the orb. Izan goes to talk to him but is stopped half way across the room by a male gnome [[Ernest]]. He asks Izan about possibly starting a business opportunity between the Syndicate and the Sheffield & Co. (carriage company).

He then continues to the dwarf who also recognizes Izan. The dwarf is a weapons dealer and is very interested in one of the items.

He then talks to Ernest again and agrees to listen to his proposal.

### The Bidding
- The Imp Bones go for $2000 gold. Bought by a pair of halflings. (One of the halflings keeps shooting glances at our table)
- The flower goes to Kebble the battle dwarf.
- Izan puts an initial bid of $2000$ for the Orb, Grimsby casts Hypnotic pattern on Kebble's table and 11 people in the area slump over. Izan gets it eventually for $2500$
- The halflings immeditaly raises his paddle for $2500$, Izan stands up to question the authenticity of the bottle. Cazrick is appalled that he would question the integrity of the auction. Harper stands as well and reveals her identity as daughter of the Bottle's owner. 

### The Heated Battle
Cazrick goes into panic mode, grabs the bottle and flees out the back door. The Duergar around the room draw their weapons and engage us in combat. They grow in size and attempt to stop us. Harper casts Fly and soars over their heads to chase after Cazrick. After a short combat encounter we flee onto the stage and Harper casts Wall of Fire to trap the Duergar on the other side of the room. A few try to get through the wall and collapse from the damage. 

### The Goat, the Sorcerer, and the Bottle
The building starts to go up in flames as we chase Cazrick down the alleyway outside. Grimsby uses the goat bag to send a Giant Goat running after Cazrick. We catch up to find Cazrick cowering in a corner of the alley with the Giant Goat gnawing on his pant leg.

Harper and Izan intimidate Cazrick into telling them where he got the bottle and the rest of the items. He tells us that they were all received from [[Ernest]]. He just runs the auction, but Ernest supplies the goods.

We leave Cazrick and head to the entrance of the building where we see a deserted alleyway after the auction goers fled. The building is lit up in flames as [[Roker Lee]] arrives and Izan expertly convinces him that we were just in the area and are willing to help put the fire out. Harper over the next few minutes uses Control Flames to put the fire out. Roker thanks us and we make our way out of the alley.
