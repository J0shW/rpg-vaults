We arrive at Farmer’s Nook. 
The town appears to be deserted. We walk to the main building, it’s boarded up. We knock but nobody responds. 

None of the flyers on the notice board are recent at all. But we notice the letters COTS etched on the board. 

We finally see a middle aged female dwarf in work wear. It’s [[Gelda]] the person Fez sent us to meet. We follow Gelda to her house, neat but old. We see many figurines, paintings, etc with iconography of a dragon. Cael (sounds like Jael, Kie-elle).

She makes us tea.  She tells us they have a group of hooligans, goblins, etc. Led by a big guy. They came a few months ago and were requesting a portion of our crops. They keep returning demanding more. This in when she requests help from Adelgate. She believes they reside nearby. Happens every week. 

Her husband Fred comes down to meet us. Gelda is willing to scribble us a map to reach their camp. Gelda recommends approaching them stealthily or disguised.

Their hideout is northwest of Farmer’s Nook. He head out and after a few hours we see a mound in the ground with hulking hyena’s walking circles around the area. We wait an hour until the bandits leave their den to go harass Farmer’s Nook, this way we can go into the den with less risk.

One of the creatures is huge and smells terrible. They travel with the hulking figure in the middle, surrounded by Gnolls riding dogs and there’s a few humanoids walking with them.  

Once the group is out of sight, we make our way through the grass to the dune. Surrounding the dune is a ring of dirt. There is an opening in the mound.  

We enter. Go down a hallway, enter a room on the right. It is an eating quarters with bedrolls on the side. There are 8 bedrolls, but nothing else of interest here. 

We continue down the main hallway. Enter a large room with rocks stacked up. Harper says it looks like a really big chair. There is a rope holding a bag of rocks up over the entrance to the room.   

I investigate the throne, it has writing on the back that says VORKOR. We don’t know what that  means.

We plan to stay in the large room while Grimsby is outside. Grimsby sends us a message when the bandits approach. I cast invisibility on myself so iI can wait by the rope holding the rocks up without anyone seeing.

After the battle we find 3 bottles on the ogre's body. Potion of healing, potion of climbing, and some gold.  

653 gold, and 302 silver.

We defeat the monsters. A crack opens up in a wall, with a brilliant light pouring through.
