## 44th of Growth

### The Cute Assassin
We break into an empty warehouse. Tie up the sloth and drop the Polymorph spell on him. We cast charm person and question him.

Name is Merrick
Works for the Tranquil Blade (High level assassins for hire)
Hired to kill Izen

Bring info to Meeshka. She runs the [[Tranquil Blade]]. Dark brown hair, tan skin, almost elvish looking. Izen recognizes this as the person he saw in the alleyway when he originally got the mask.
No meeting place, just get drops when needed.

Was supposed to meet at the Waterfront Inn tomorrow.

They had been following us most of the day.
[[Grimsby]] adds Merrick to her sending book.
We will send him a message if we kill Meeshka.

Izen says we will take care of Merrick's family.

We return to the Syndicate for a short sleep.

We find [[Cazia Parovsky]] talking to [[Kebble]] the Dwarf from the auction. He is looking to acquire the Flower. We give it to him. He is upset that we cast Hypnotic pattern to stop them from bidding.

We tell Cazia about the meeting with Meeshka tomorrow.

Cazia also has info on the [[Children of the Sky]]. The group has travelled north to the [[Adelcrest Forest]] and have visited many towns in that area. Have been reports of these cultists appearing in [[Shep Shed]].

Izen then speaks to Cazia privately. She asks about the orb from the auction. She offers to examine it and do some longer research on it to learn more about the technology.

She goes on to say the real reason she wanted to speak with Izen was to ask him to interrogate a prisoner they have locked up. The individual was caught snooping around their organization. Want to know who he is and why he is here. Shaggy brown hair, big beard. She says they are not in the business of torture.

Izen also asks about [[Jasper]]'s father [[Barret Flint]]. She says all she knows if that he left his home abruptly in [[Cattlestok]] after selling his business and possessions. Friends of his say he seemed nervous and skittish around the time he left.

### The Prisoner
Izen wakes Jasper and asks him to come with him to interrogate the prisoner. Jasper casts invisibility on himself and gets Quill to write notes to Izen to help with the question asking.
He is a shaggy unkempt man. Izen tries to persuade him to speak to no avail. Izen tries to intimidate the man and gets the man angry. He leaps up and graps the cell bars and yells in Izen's face. "You want to know why I'm here. To kill you for murdering my wife!". At this moment with the man now standing in the torch Jasper recognizes the man
