## 44th of Growth

### The Cute Assassin
We break into an empty warehouse. Tie up the sloth and drop the Polymorph spell on him. We cast charm person and question him.

Name is Merrick
Works for the Tranquil Blade (High level assassins for hire)
Hired to kill Izen

Bring info to Meeshka. She runs the [[Tranquil Blade]]. Dark brown hair, tan skin, almost elvish looking. Izen recognizes this as the person he saw in the alleyway when he originally got the mask.
No meeting place, just get drops when needed.

Was supposed to meet at the Waterfront Inn tomorrow.

They had been following us most of the day.
[[Grimsby]] adds Merrick to her sending book.
We will send him a message if we kill Meeshka.

Izen says we will take care of Merrick's family.

We return to the Syndicate for a short sleep.

We find [[Cazia Parovsky]] talking to [[Kebble]] the Dwarf from the auction. He is looking to acquire the Flower. We give it to him. He is upset that we cast Hypnotic pattern to stop them from bidding.

We tell Cazia about the meeting with Meeshka tomorrow.

Cazia also has info on the [[Children of the Sky]]. The group has travelled north to the [[Adelcrest Forest]] and have visited many towns in that area. Have been reports of these cultists appearing in [[Shep Shed]].

Izen then speaks to Cazia privately. She asks about the orb from the auction. She offers to examine it and do some longer research on it to learn more about the technology.

She goes on to say the real reason she wanted to speak with Izen was to ask him to interrogate a prisoner they have locked up. The individual was caught snooping around their organization. Want to know who he is and why he is here. Shaggy brown hair, big beard. She says they are not in the business of torture.

Izen also asks about [[Jasper]]'s father [[Barret Flint]]. She says all she knows if that he left his home abruptly in [[Cattlestok]] after selling his business and possessions. Friends of his say he seemed nervous and skittish around the time he left.

### The Prisoner
Izen wakes Jasper and asks him to come with him to interrogate the prisoner. Jasper casts invisibility on himself and gets Quill to write notes to Izen to help with the question asking.
He is a shaggy unkempt man. Izen tries to persuade him to speak to no avail. Izen tries to intimidate the man and gets the man angry. He leaps up and grasps the cell bars and yells in Izen's face. "You want to know why I'm here. To kill you for murdering my wife, Cassandra Flint!". At this moment with the man now standing in the torchlight, Jasper recognizes the man. He is [[Barret Flint]] his father!!

Jasper immediately drops invisibility and runs to his father. Barret is confused, thinking Izen has cast a spell to make him see a vision of his son. Jasper assures him he is real. That everything is going to be ok and that they'll get him out of there. Barret is furious, telling Jasper to get away from Izen because he murdered your mother. Jasper is unsure about the truth of the situation and casts Zone of Truth. He asks Izen to tell him that he didn't kill his mother. Izen does so and this seems to slowly begin to reassure Barret. But he seems very confused and exhausted. He tells us that [[Cassandra Flint]] was also a Journalist and got into a story that got her killed. This is why he never spoke to her to Jasper, to protect him from the people that killed his wife. And also why he hated when Jasper began to write and become a Journalist.

After Jasper left home to move to Adelgate, Barret became very unstable and couldn't handle the loss of his wife alone. He set out to kill the man that murdered her. He contracted the [[Tranquil Blade]] and paid [[Meeshka]] to assassinate Izen. Meeshka soon after told Barret that it had been done and that Izen was dead. But not a year later it seems that Izen is alive and well. So Barret becomes erratic again and once again hire Meeshka to finish the job once and for all. 

Izen and Jasper assure him we will clear all of this up. They ask Barret to end the contract with Meeshka to kill Izen.  They free Barret from the cell. He hugs Jasper and weeps. 

End of session.
