## 44th of Growth

### The Cute Assassin
We break into an empty warehouse. Tie up the sloth and drop the Polymorph spell on him. We cast charm person and question him.

Name is Merrick
Works for the Tranquil Blade (High level assassins for hire)
Hired to kill Izen

Bring info to Meeshka. She runs the [[Tranquil Blade]]. Dark brown hair, tan skin, almost elvish looking. Izen recognizes this as the person he saw in the alleyway when he originally got the mask.
No meeting place, just get drops when needed.

Was supposed to meet at the Waterfront Inn tomorrow.

They had been following us most of the day.
[[Grimsby]] adds Merrick to her sending book.
We will send him a message if we kill Meeshka.

Izen says we will take care of Merrick's family.

We return to the Syndicate for a short sleep.

We find [[Cazia Parovsky]] talking to [[Kebble]] the Dwarf from the auction. He is looking to acquire the Flower. We give it to him. He is upset that we cast Hypnotic pattern to stop them from bidding.

We tell Cazia about the meeting with Meeshka tomorrow.

Cazia also has info on the [[Children of the Sky]]. The group has travelled north to the [[Adelcrest Forest]] and have visited many towns in that area. Have been reports of these cultists appearing in [[Shep Shed]].
