# `fas:PenNib` Session 7: January 03, 2021
---

The next day Izan receives another letter from [[Cazia Parovsky]]. 

We go to Sheffield & Co. to rent a carriage for passage to [[Mahrez]]. Logo is 2 crossed scimitars with a carriage in the middle. We rent a carriage for 25gp with a driver named [[Richard]], stout dwarf.

On the 4th day of travel, we encounter a huge statue of a creature in the fetal position. There is also a small gnome curled up in front of it. His name is [[Popper Chaddletop]]. His construct friend had it's magical rune stolen from bandits. 

We decide to go into the forest to find the rune to fix Popper's construct. 

We encounter Owl Bears. [[Harper]] cast Fly on all of us to escape.
Then we encounter some evil Vines that nearly kill us.

Finally, we find the bandit camp. It is deserted. I cast invisibility on myself and sneak in to find the missing rune. Inside the empty tents I find:
- A vile of red liquid that is smoking near the top
- A pair of gloves
- A ring with the head of a ram
- A pouch of gold (720 gold pieces)
- A magical rune which belongs to the construct.

All of a sudden Gnolls surround the camp. There are 2 larger ones and 8 regular ones. Cliffhanger!
