# `fas:PenNib` Session 7: January 03, 2021
---

The next day Izan receives another letter from [[Cazia Parovsky]]. 

We go to Sheffield & Co. to rent a carriage for passage to [[Mahrez]]. Logo is 2 crossed scimitars with a carriage in the middle. We rent a carriage for 25gp with a driver named [[Richard]], stout dwarf.

On the 4th day of travel, we encounter a huge statue of a creature in the fetal position. There is also a small gnome curled up in front of it.

A vile of red liquid that is smoking near the top, a pair of gloves, a ring with the head of a ram. Also a pouch of gold, and an interesting magical rune which belongs to the construct.

Gnolls surround the camp. There are 2 larger ones.
