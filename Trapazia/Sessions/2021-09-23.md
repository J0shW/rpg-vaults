## 14th of Growth

### Cascardia

[[Cascardia]] is a massive city of rolling hills.

[[Izan]] and [[Jasper]] make their way to the palace. It is surrounded by a gated wall with guards.

We plan to walk up and try to gain entry by just talking. We decide to basically tell the truth. We were sent to find the one who can change history. The guards go ask and return, but say [[Azalea Roust]] is very busy.

We say we are from another land, brought here to help the queen. We can raise her father briefly so that she can gain some closure about his passing.

We are taken into the palace. We are introduced to Azalea. I notice a sadness but also a discomfort about her having to do with her new role as Queen.

She is solemn but excited to speak with her father. We are taken to his glass casket in the great hall. [[Jasper]] casts speak with the dead. And tells Azalea she can ask 5 questions. 
-Do you love me? "Yes"
-Am I going to do well as Queen? "Of Course"
-How am I going to do this without you? "You can do anything."
-Do you have any reason to believe you were murdered? "No, my health was failing"

Azalea is satisfied and collapses on the ground in tears.

[[Jasper]] asks the final question.
-Do you know who the one that can change the world is?
"That's easy, my daughter Azalea."

### The Research Institute
Small grounds. Group of people gathered to hear a speech. The dean, a dwarf named [[Gertrude]], introduces the speaker who is a gnome named [[Soarise Kim]].

After the presentation, Grimsby and Harper do a display of magic to convince the dean Gertrude to show them around. Nobody else on campus can do magic. The last person they visit on the tour is [[Jawree]], he has a bunch of those winged cats.

As soon as they meet Jari, all four of us and swept up into a time vortex again.

### Years Later
We are transported back to the Sphynx who tells us to help the one who can change the world.

We are transported back into  [[Jawree]]'s office. He asks us to collect items for him. We have to go outside the borders of the city. 

Jawree believes the winged cats are what keeps the storms at bay within the city. Outside the city is constant dangerous thunderstorms.

If we take these two cats with us, we will be safe from the storms.
Scatter is the name of the gray one and Cupcake, the tortoise shell one.

He gives us a map which leads us in a general Eastward direction.

We walk down the coast line along a cliffs edge. We encounter 2 statues guarding an opening in the cliff face.
"One guard tells nothing but the truth, the other only lies"

We figure out the right answer, but Izan accidentally says the wrong statue is the liar. At that moment a bug sandstone golem appears and attacks us because we answered wrong.

We defeat it but both Izan and Kilikar have lost a ton of health.

The guards lift up their spears and allow us to enter into the opening in the cliff.

End of session.
