## 14th of Growth

### Cascardia

[[Cascardia]] is a massive city of rolling hills.

[[Izan]] and [[Jasper]] make their way to the palace. It is surrounded by a gated wall with guards.

### The Research Institute
Small grounds. Group of people gathered to hear a speech. The dean, a dwarf named [[Gertrude]], introduces the speaker who is a gnome named [[Soarise Kim]].
