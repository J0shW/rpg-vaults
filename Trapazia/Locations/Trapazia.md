## Water Landmarks
### Suclidian Ocean
#### Landscape
The primary body of water that falls to the west of Trapazia. Not much is known past this body of water as any explorers who have ventured to discover new lands have never returned. There are uninhabited and undiscovered islands off the coast. There are regions in the ocean that are said to be cursed and prone to shipwrecks. The most widely told is the “Hourglass of the Tempest”.

### Delarin Strait
#### Landscape
The body of water that connects the Suclidian Ocean to the Delarin Bay. It splits two major cities (Maldobrine and Port Valoor) and is a readily used waterway during times of peace.

### Delarin Bay
#### Landscape
A large body of water that cuts into the west coast of Trapazia. Often commented as the mouth of Trapazia, it provides many smaller and larger settlements with a means to travel and a source of food.

### Delarin River
#### Landscape
A river that off-shoots from the Adel river and that flows into the Delarin Bay.

### Adel River
#### Landscape
The largest known river in Trapazia that flows all the way from the Crescent Range to the Suclidian ocean. Some sections of the long spanning river have been known to contain gold deposits; this has been the source of Adelgate’s prosperity and prominence in the region.

## Terrain Landmarks
### Crescent Range
#### Landscape
An expansive mountain range named after its crescent shape that spans the region. Home to many settlements and tribes.

### The Central Planes
#### Landscape
The vast and beautiful green meadows that surround Adelgate. While beautiful and vast, many dangerous creatures call this place home.
