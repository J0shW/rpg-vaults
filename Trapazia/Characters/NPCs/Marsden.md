**Race**: 
**Class**: 
**Notes**: 

- Handwritten note: To [[Marsden]]. From the Captain Sasionel
```
“My dearest Marsden, I hope that Alliga grants me this one last wish, and that this message finds you. The voyage has proven to be too much for our crew and our ship. We expected pirates, the storms that plague these waters, and even the dangerous creatures that call these waters their home. But we could not prepare for this… (writ-ing gets hurried) I must hurry, we don’t have much time. All I want you to know is that no matter what becomes of me, our paths will cross again, in this life or the next. Until that day, I love you with all my heart. Forever yours, Sasionel”
```

Alliga is the Mother of the Sea, the God of the Oceans

We contemplate how the ship got here into the middle of the desert and who this Sasionel could be.
