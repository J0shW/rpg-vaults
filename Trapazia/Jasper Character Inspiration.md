### Interview random NPC's, Businesses, etc.
#### Offer Calligraphy sign making skills in return for an interview
Go about the town and ask about businesses around town. 
As I walk through the streets try to find a business with a derelict sign. 
I offer the owner my Calligraphy sign making skills in return for a few coin to bring their sign back to the shine it once had.
Of course while there get a quick interview in with the owner.
- [ ] Ask for general info on the city
- [ ] Ask for info regarding the current situation our players are in
