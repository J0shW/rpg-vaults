### History
Jasper found it in the empty house of his missing father [[Barret Flint]].

Jasper uses it to cast his spells.

### The Quill
Jasper casts legend lore in the [[Quill]]. He sees a storybook play out in front of his eyes:
- A quill picked up my young elven woman
- quill levitates as if enchanted
- was originally just a writing tool
- has seen a lot
- written many things
- has written iconic and important stories
- The Quills owner was widely recognized
- A moment where the quill changed
- The owner was someone bonded to the quill
- An element of the owner is in that quill
- Then the quill was given to you.
- The bonding of the quill to an owner was originally against its will.
- I believe that [[Cassandra Flint]] enchanted the Quill and somehow bonder herself to it and may now be trapped within it.
