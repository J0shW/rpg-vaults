## Frostfall 47, 13984

### Ringmaster 
We play ring toss during the pre-gaming for Ringmaster 
Solomon beats Basil in a shootout 

Ringmaster starts and Pod (stage name Dop) fights Finnicus the minotaur 

In the stands at Rringmaster Basil encounters some Orcs who were in the dark hand and Origfinally from the same region as him.
From them he learns that after he ran away from his clan their clan (the Dynamite clan) invaded it.

Shawna Laxton (owner of the fighting arena) asks Pod to become a professional fighter

The next day Edric shows up and asks us to do the training simulator 

We go in. Our objective is to defend the Kahosta attack from attackers as long as we can

Right after we get in there is a visual glitch  Solomon sees Shabaka's wings change color. Basil sees a flash of a large creature with claws where Pod was standing.

Then Solomon sees a flash of a different landscape, and then were all In a completely white space. Then we are At the portal inthe basement of the kahosta estate.

A purple energy tornado is in front of us; but dosent suck Us in. It seems to have it's own essence - be almost sentient

There are red and green (alternating color) around the dome structure that the vortex is in.
