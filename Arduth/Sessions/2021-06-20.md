## Frostfall 36, 13982

### The Corrupted Grove

We take a short rest. [[Sully]] gives me healing because I ran out of hit dice.

[[Pod]], [[Bobble]], and [[Basil]] have a discussion about diversifying our abilities.

We move forward and encounter some strange yellow webbing that's blocking the pathway.

[[Basil]] uses firebolt to burn up the webbing and clearing our path.

We then hear "All flesh must rot" must a disembodied voice that seems to echo menacingly throughout the grove.

[[Pod]] tries showing off by jumping a pool of acid. [[Sully]] sees this and wants to try also. He makes it, but [[Valkyrie]] grazes the ooze when landing. 

This causes a big Ooze tree ([[Yok'lol]]) to rise out of the acid pool.

It has many limbs and can create new yellow webs when it moves.
A spider also jumps out at us.

We fight [[Yok'lol]], which keeps healing itself and creating webs which is very annoying.

More spiders jump out of the trees.

[[Otaniae]] appears out of nowhere to help us and attacks [[Yok'lol]].

[[Shabaka]] got the final hit on [[Yok'lol]].

[[Yok'lol]] then tries turning into a puddle to escape. 

But [[Vodaire]] and many other tree being appear.

[[Vodaire]] says [[Yok'lol]] needs to die. We try to ask if we can save him by removing the corruption, but [[Vodaire]] says he's beyond saving. [[Vodaire]] stretches out a hand and with a magical grasp petrifies [[Yok'lol]] and turns him into a staff with a petrified spider on top.

End of session.
