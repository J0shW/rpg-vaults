## Frostfall 36, 13982

### The Grove Pathway

We take a short rest. [[Sully]] gives me healing because I ran out of hit dice.

[[Pod]], [[Bobble]], and [[Basil]] have a discussion about diversifying our abilities.

We move forward and encounter some strange yellow webbing that's blocking the pathway.

[[Basil]] uses Firebolt to burn up the webbing and clearing our path.

We then hear "All flesh must rot" must a disembodied voice that seems to echo menacingly throughout the grove.
