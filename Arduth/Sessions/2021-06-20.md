## Frostfall 36, 13982

### The Grove Pathway

We take a short rest. [[Sully]] gives me healing because I ran out of hit dice.

[[Pod]], [[Bobble]], and [[Basil]] have a discussion about diversifying our abilities.

We move forward and encounter some strange yellow webbing that's blocking the pathway.

[[Basil]] uses Firebolt to burn up the webbing and clearing our path.

We then hear "All flesh must rot" must a disembodied voice that seems to echo menacingly throughout the grove.

[[Pod]] tries showing off by jumping a pool of acid. [[Sully]] sees this and wants to try also. He makes it, but [[Valkyrie]] grazes the ooze when landing. 

This causes a big Ooze tree to rise out of the acid pool.

It has many limbs and can create new yellow webs when it moves.
A spider also jumps out at us.
