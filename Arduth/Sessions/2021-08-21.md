## Frostfall 42, 13984

###

Pod is frustrated that he couldn't find the source of his powers easily. 

[[Shabaka]] is packing up for his move to [[Deadman's Respite]]

## Frostfall 43, 13984

[[Pod]] asks [[Basil]] how to figure out where his powers come from. Basil decides to set up an experiment.

[[Solomon]] and the rest of us go to talk to [[Alma]] at the temple. We wanted to know about [[Uuli]] the floating guy who disappeared from the council meeting. She tells us to go ask [[Alfia]] at the Town Hall.

[[Quince]] greets us at the Town Hall front desk. He is a teenage human boy. 

He leads us to the office of [[Alfia]]. They tell us that they don't know much about [[Uuli]]. They seem to be mostly a clerical error in their paperwork. But their name goes back in the council documents for a long time. 

We split up. [[Bobble]] and [[Basil]] go to the archives to look through the council documents. [[Pod]] and [[Solomon]] stay at the [[Town Hall]] to investigate some of the old office spaces to look for any presence of Uuli.


## The Archives
The name [[Uuli]] was on the meeting minutes of the council for the past 50 years, but the attendance checkbox was never checked. So they are on the paperwork, but have never actually showed up.

They talk to [[Jessa]], the Librarian. To see if they know anything about Uuli. They don't know anything about Uuli, but agree to help look through the documents.

They return to the archives. They look another 50 years beyond that, and the name Uuli is still on the list, but never in attendance.

At the end of the day they find one single meeting document where Uuli's attendance box has a question mark written in it. Frostfall 84,13976

So 8 years ago [[Uuli]] appears as possibly being in attendance.

The other names listed as council members on that date are:
Drak Ardu - Headmaster
Rena Cota
Isacola - gnome
Mordecai - high priest
Kozmonian Fizzlecaster - Battlemaster (very serious human, with a humongous white dog as his companion named Luna)
Alah Markeezy - Master of Ceremonies (Italian dude, very serious about the orchestra)

We are able to see some strange scribbling on the meeting minutes.
```
- Sickness?
- Mist?
- Kahosta Estate?
```

## Town Hall
Pod and Solomon go to town hall to look for clues.
While looking for empty offices they have a strange experience - can't exactly nail down how many empty offices their are - count 10 but it sort of feels like they have a deja view experience while counting one
They search the empty offices, making a notch on each door as they search it - search 10 empty offices without finding anything interesting 
Solomon casts commune to contact his diety :
- Are there 10 empty offices in this building? - thumbs up
- Do any of the offices belong to [[Uuli]] - thumbs down
- Can the answers we're looking for be found in the town hall - thumb completely sideways
