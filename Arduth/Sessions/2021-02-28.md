### Solomon Event
[[Solomon]] wakes up and sees the word Corvidae on the gravestone that he had been sleeping on. Then he gets attacked by crows. It seems like a dream or something. Then he’s face to face with Mordecai. Solomon tells him that he feels lost and doesn’t know what to do. Whether he should join the shadow council in Dead Man’s Respite. Or stay in Arduth with Alma. Corvidae is a person?? He tricked the Kenku people into where they are now. To restore the Kenku they need to bring Corvidae back. They need 3 parts of Corvidae (beak, feather and bone). The beak can restore speech to the Kenku and is how Solomon is able to talk. The feather is already in Solomon’s possession. The bone is nowhere to be found. Mordecai then leaves him and Solomon awakes in the cemetery again hugging the gravestone. Solomon can no longer speak, only squawk. Coralin?

Via, Beyrang, Stayrang, and Kalleeg came from Respite to Arduth. Kalleeg is a female Air Genasi that’s really talkative.

Solomon’s old Deity is Mordecai, but now follows Corallin? He encounters Corallin in the Temple who gives him his voice back.

### In the Kohasta Estate

The mayor’s Aid, Quince, delivers a letter to Solomon and to Shabacca. The letters contain information about volunteering to join Respite.
