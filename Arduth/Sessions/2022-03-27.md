## Frostfall ??, 13982

Inside the cave, [[Basil]]'s horn starts speaking faintly. It says "Return to me". We try a number of things to understand it. We glean that this may not be a horn, but rather a claw froma dragon. Eventually [[Pod]] thinking there might be some connection between him and [[Brukahn]] takes the horn and starts to rage. Lighting surrounds him and the horn and Brukahn starts to speak to him.

He wants to be freed from his prison and promises power in return. It sounds like a bad idea, but Pod is very tempted. We decide to learn more first and venture further into the cave.

Further in it opens up into a large cavern with a few small off shoots to other rooms. The is another dragon in the center of the room who has glasses and a scarf. They aren't aware 

### Brukahn  
[[Brukahn]] was ruling over East Ren. He had captured by the balance and imprisoned in this crystal cave. The cave itself has been designed here because it is remote. An open space to prevent Brukahns destructive power. The balance captures him because there was a lot of destruction. Brukahn was trying to control the people of East Ren. It’s written as if they have overthrown a tyrant.  
  
Very much condemning Brukahn as a tyrannical presence. They don’t discuss how Brukahn came into power. No events detailed about his rise to power. Things might be left out.  
  
Brukahn is a specialist of destruction. Is powerful because of how much damage he can do.  
  
### The Balance  
[[The Balance]] was formed a long time ago. It was formed for an event called [[The Second Coming]].  
  
[[The Last Stand For Existence]] happened even longer ago. There were 6 champions.  
  
They were fighting 6 entities. There are represented in the symbology of the balance.  
1. [[Brukahn]] - East Ren (dragon)  
2. [[Tulangi]] - North Ren (purple skinned women with black eyes)  
3. [[Vakuush]] - (an abstract spiritual essence)  
4. [[Jigah’zo]] - West Ren (amorphous plant mound)  
5. [[Zikariel]] - South Ren (demonic creature)  
6. [[Kahosta]] - (Angel- a figure bisected into a dark side and a light side)  
  
The Balance was formed around THE HEART OF REN  
  
### Avian collective  
The avian collective had been historically led by Corvidae.  
  
[[[Corvidae]]] - Raven  
[[Quorrelin]] - Crow  
[[Woelcan]] - Vulture  
[[Siwu]] - Owl  
[[Kotaria]] - Eagle  
  
Rules to prevent infighting. Birds can’t attack other birds. It’s a serious offense.  
  
Vague concept called[[ The Bird Cage]]  
  
### The Blip  
[[The Blip]], also known as the plague.  
13976 Frostfall 83  
The mist being compromised. The guardian being damaged. Vakuush being compromised. Gustav Dumas’s failed escape. Also reference to some unprecedented storm at Brukahn’s peak.  
  
Second incident called [[The Schism]] (13983 Solaris 82) (last year). Reports of scattered mass teleportations. Reports of a lot of chaos in the balance dealing with the teleportations. This is when [[The Dark Hand]] got teleported into Arduth. Amongst the teleportations they say Kahosta’s champion is secured and Gustav was freed. This is when Sebastian jumped through the portal with Aza. They also say a significant resource had been compromised and Kahosta will need to recover.  
  
### The Champions  
East Ren (1619 post Brukahn)  
  
South Ren (4863 deliverance) - Zikariel is contained  
  
West Ren (8421) - Jigah’zo is contained by the balance.  
  
North Ren (year 11 since death, before that year 452 since frost, 836 since wither) - nothing about Tulanji. Never contained.  
  
Arduth (13984) - The year of the second coming. Kahosta is contained. But Lahosta is now at large.  
  
Vakuush has been restored. The source of the mist. They are on the side of the balance. Might be a chaotic presence, because they have helped us at times.  
  
Tulanji was attacking the Dark Hand in North Ren and the Dark hand escaped by teleporting to Arduth last year.  
  
### The Cave  
Find some maps.  
Cave was setup as both a means of containing Brukahn and as a way-station for travel with the balance. Difficult to get it working well for travel.  
  
The cave uses Brukahns outbursts of magical energy as a battery to fuel magical research.  
The ventilation system. And energy ventilation system. A number of different vents that release different types of energy. They pertain to the different schools of magic. Suggests that Brukahn power is above the traditional schools of magic.  
  
All the energy lines route to the southwest lower corner of the cavern. That’s were Brukahn is located.  
  
### The Crystals  
Talk about crystals. Ambient energy of the caverns can bring out the magical properties of some gems. Different crystals pertain to different schools of magic.  
  
The Behavior of gems under different energy states. The 3 states are: Harvest, Syphon or Release.
  
### Arduth  
Arduth is also known as Central Ren. Before The Second Coming, Ren was one land mass. After The Second Coming, Ren had broken up, split apart into four corners and a center land mass. Arduth then became Kahosta’s prison.  
  
Kahosta’s energy is very chaotic and extra-planar. Her power is the most dangerous because of her extra-planar reach. That’s how a bunch of people got teleported around. Arduth was built to prevent extra-planar travel. The mist is containing Kahosta into one plane.  
  
Arduth was once a public area. Like a city with portals that could take people from the balance all over. Widely known to be the place that contained the prison of Kahosta.  
  
There was an event where Kahosta almost escaped. So the balance shut down the openness of Arduth and entrusted the care of it to its citizens.  
  
One point of connection to The Balance. The High Priestess.  
  
The citizens of Arduth are a sleeper army in case anything goes wrong.  
  
If Tulanji escaped why was the “sleeper army” not called upon.
