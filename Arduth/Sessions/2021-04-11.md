# New Chapter!

## Frostfall 36, 13982

### Solomon's Departure
- Solomon talks to Alma. He feels some relief that he isn't going to Respite, but also insn't sure if he was actually meant to go. Not sure if staying in Arduth is his actual path.

### A New Friend
Sully the halfling ranger and Valkyrie his wolf. Says there's something out there fueling nightmares. He has a community out here called the Valkyrie clan. Some members include Jimbob and Jolene.

We hear a sound nearby and see a beak pop out of the brush.
