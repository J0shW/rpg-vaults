# New Chapter!

## Frostfall 36, 13982

### Solomon's Departure
- Solomon talks to Alma. He feels some relief that he isn't going to Respite, but also insn't sure if he was actually meant to go. Not sure if staying in Arduth is his actual path.

### A New Friend
Sully the halfling ranger and Valkyrie his wolf. Says there's something out there fueling nightmares. He has a community out here called the Valkyrie clan. Some members include Jimbob and Jolene.

We hear a sound nearby and see a beak pop out of the brush. It's a baby OwlBear. Sully casts speak with animals and the owlbear cub leads us to its den under a tree. We pass many puddles of ooze along the way.

We wait until the mother owlbear shows up. Sully speaks with it and lets it know that we mean it no harm. The mother and cub reunite.

Then we see monkeys in the trees throwing some of the ooze at us. We chase them. They seem to be grabbing ooze from inside the trees. We eventually catch up with the monkeys who seem afraid of something up ahead. We try to interrogate the monkeys to no avail.

Up ahead we see many fallen trees with ooze pouring out them. it seems something is corrupting the trees and wildlife.

We follow the fell trees to a dense, dark area. We proceed with caution and encounter a beast with 3 glowing yellow eyes and ooze seeping out of itself. 

We engage in combat. The creature keeps trying to infect us with the ooze whenever we attack it, but to no avail. Basil gets the final blow with couple Minute Meteors.
