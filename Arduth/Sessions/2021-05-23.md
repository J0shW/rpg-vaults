## Frostfall 36, 13982

### The Unknown Forest
This forest is weird. Bizarre vegetation. Conifers are shedding their leaves which makes no sense. There is still some mist surrounding the area.

We are facing an upward slope of trees, with a trail of ooze leading up the slope. A smell of smoldering rot fills the air. The trees appear to grow in the wrong direction as if the ground has shifted to create this slope.

Bobble says [[Vodaire]] is an evil tree wizard.

Sully wants to learn from Basil. Sully tells Basil to be more impulsive and not overthink things.
