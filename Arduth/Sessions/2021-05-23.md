## Frostfall 36, 13982

### The Unknown Forest
This forest is weird. Bizarre vegetation. Conifers are shedding their leaves which makes no sense. There is still some mist surrounding the area.

We are facing an upward slope of trees, with a trail of ooze leading up the slope. A smell of smoldering rot fills the air. The trees appear to grow in the wrong direction as if the ground has shifted to create this slope.

Bobble says [[Vodaire]] is an evil tree wizard.

Sully wants to learn from Basil. Sully tells Basil to be more impulsive and not overthink things.

We start up the slope and immediately encounter 3 boulder creatures that roll toward us.

Sully climbs a tree to try and get a height advantage. The tree comes alive and starts trying to attack Sully! It shoots out vines at Sully, Valkyrie, Basil and Pod.

We defeat the boulders and trees.

Sully speaks with a tree. It tells him [[Yok'lol]] is behind the corruption. Yok'lol used to be protector of the forest but has been corrupted.

Bobble thinks that Vodaire might be behind all of this.

The trees say otherwise, "Vodaire is our protector, Yok'lol is fallen."

Not all trees are infected, but warriors of the fallen hide among them. The trees will help point out the evil trees along our path.

We also ask about [[Otaniae]], the trees also agree that he is a protector of the forest.

We sneak forward and the trees shake when they are hosting an evil entity. We sneak around most of them. But encounter more boulder creatures in a clearing.

We discover that attacking the center creature seems to hurt all 3 of them. We dispatch of the boulders quickly. 

Then we deal with the vine assassin that has been popping out from the trees. It is the same creature each time, moving between the trees and popping out at us.

The vine assassin gives Sully a shied made of gnarled wood with his dying breath and tells him to save the forest.

We reach the top of the hill, and encounter a long straight pathway of trees curling in to form a narrow dark hallway almost.
