## Frostfall 36, 13982

### The Unknown Forest
This forest is weird. Bizarre vegetation. Conifers are shedding their leaves which makes no sense. There is still some mist surrounding the area.

There are trails of ooze leading somewhere. A smell of smoldering rot fills the air.

Bobble says [[Vodaire]] is an evil tree wizard.
