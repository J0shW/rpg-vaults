### Nil Game Part 2

We follow some ooze into a portal in a tree. On the other side is a black environment. We follow the ooze, it heads towards a pinkish green platform amidst the dark room. There are floating yellow orbs around the area.

[[Vodaire]] is the voice that speaks to [[Shabaka]], he appears to him sometimes. He said "We have eyes everywhere, Otaniae". Otaniae is a tree creature from a previous adventure.
