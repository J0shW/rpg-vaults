## Frostfall 36, 13982

### Nil Game Part 2

We follow some ooze into a portal in a tree. On the other side is a black environment. We follow the ooze, it heads towards a pinkish green platform amidst the dark room. There are floating yellow orbs around the area.

We fight some shadow creatures and a vine creature. Shabaka retrieves an [[Orb]] once the creatures are dead.

[[Vodaire]] appears and speaks to [[Shabaka]], he appears to him sometimes. He said "We have eyes everywhere, Otaniae". Otaniae is a tree creature from a previous adventure.

We follow the ooze through another portal and wind up in a forest.
