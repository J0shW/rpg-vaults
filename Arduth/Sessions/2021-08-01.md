## Frostfall 37, 13982

### 
After leaving Sully in the forest, we return to Arduth

Solomon is doing research in the library, when everyone suddenly get's up and seems to leave in a rush.
They're all looking at a beacon of light outside on the South-East edge of the city.

We emerge from the woods into The Wild and can see the beacon of light too.

Solomon is approaching us and we tell him about our adventure.
He already knew about the lumberjacks and had quickly tried to tell Basil before we left, but it was very rushed.

Solomon thinks that the beacon of light might be The Balance

The Balance:
Supposedly some sort of mythical order that ensures that the balance of the universe is in place
They've been sending messages through Alma (only person who knows about this on the council), saying that they are going to come to Arduth.
