## Frostfall 37, 13982

### 
After leaving Sully in the forest, we return to Arduth

Solomon is doing research in the library, when everyone suddenly get's up and seems to leave in a rush.
They're all looking at a beacon of light outside on the South-East edge of the city.

We emerge from the woods into The Wild and can see the beacon of light too.
