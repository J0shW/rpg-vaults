5 rounds of influence
each round roll initiative
each round make 1 statement
each statement will target one person on the list and move that person either up or down the list

Choose target, make statement, whether you want them to move up or down, Calvin will then require you to make a skill roll to determine whether your statement was successful.

The top 3 names on the list at the end will go to Dead Man's Respite

### Round 1
Pod - Finch to stay
- We need him to keep training warriors in Arduth

Bobble - Grimsby to stay
- Because he's a great wizard

Solomon - Grimsby to stay
- Because he would cause more harm than good in Respite

Shabaka - Rena to go
- Trusts her, she'd be a valuable asset in Respite
