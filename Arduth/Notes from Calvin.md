# Notes from Calvin

Basil:
- Probably comes from SW where things are more tribal and survivalistic.
- Could have gotten to Kerrang via Riish (but costs money, may have had to save up or get favors or something)
- Or gotten through Brukahn's turmoil (waters are super risky and dangerous), then all the way around Pheonix, Angel, then to Kerrang
- Or gone from Rocky Hall through the Divide 9also super dangerous due to cave-ins, hostile life, getting lost)

Pod:
- Probably from Kerrang or Astra -- more developed cities, higher tech level
- I don't think there's any more "missing detail" for Pod.
